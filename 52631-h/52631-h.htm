<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In May 1845, Sir John Franklin sailed from England with the
ships <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, on an expedition to attempt the discovery
of a &ldquo;North-West Passage,&rdquo; or water communication between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to the North of the American Continent.
No intelligence was received from him after the year
following.</p>

<p>Numerous expeditions were fitted out and despatched in search
of Franklin and his brave crew, both from this country and from
America. In 1854, Dr Rae returned with information that the
Esquimaux had reported having seen the bodies of &ldquo;forty white
men,&rdquo; near Great Fish River, in the spring of 1850. This intelligence
was not considered trustworthy, and Lady Franklin fitted
out a private expedition, under the command of Captain M&rsquo;Clintock,
who sailed from Aberdeen in the steam-yacht <i>Fox</i>, July 1857. He
returned in 1859 with indisputable proofs of the death of Franklin,
and the fate of the expedition under his command,&mdash;full details of
which he afterwards published.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

dispatched in 1850 under Lieutenant De Haven, with Dr Kane as
surgeon. These expeditions were fitted out at New York, at the
expense of a wealthy and generous merchant of that city, named
Grinnell, and Mr Peabody, the eminent American resident in
London, whose munificence and liberality are now so well known
in this country. In the Second Expedition, the brig <i>Advance</i> was
placed under the command of Dr Elisha Kent Kane, assistant-surgeon,
U.S.N., a gentleman well qualified, from previous experience,
to undertake such an important duty.</p>

<p>Dr Kane was born at Philadelphia in 1822, and was educated at
the Medical College of Pennsylvania. In 1843 he accompanied the
embassy to China, and for some time travelled in the interior
of India. He also explored the Nile as far as the frontiers of Nubia,
Returning to America, he afterwards visited the slave-coasts of
Africa. He served in the U.S. army for a short period, and underwent
many hardships during the Mexican campaign. In 1853 he
was appointed to the command of the Arctic Expedition, a detailed
narrative of which is contained in the present volume. Dr Kane
died at Havannah in 1857, at the early age of thirty-five.</p>

<p class="caption3">ORGANIZATION&mdash;NEW YORK TO THE NORTH WATER.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">In</span> the month of December 1852, I had the honour of
receiving special orders from the Secretary of the Navy of
the United States, to &ldquo;conduct an expedition to the Arctic
Seas in search of Sir John Franklin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had been engaged, under Lieutenant De Haven, in the
Grinnell Expedition, which sailed from the United States
in 1850 on the same errand; and I had occupied myself
for some months after our return in maturing the scheme
of a renewed effort to rescue the missing party, or at least
to resolve the mystery of its fate. Mr Grinnell, with a
liberality altogether characteristic, had placed the <i>Advance</i>,
in which I sailed before, at my disposal for the cruise;
and Mr Peabody of London, the generous representative of
many American sympathies, had proffered his aid largely
toward her outfit. The Geographical Society of New
York, the Smithsonian Institution, the American Philosophical
Society, and a number of scientific association and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
friends of science besides, had come forward to help me;
and by their aid I managed to secure a better outfit for
purposes of observation than would otherwise have been
possible to a party so limited in numbers, and absorbed in
other objects.</p>

<p>Ten of our little party belonged to the United States
Navy, and were attached to my command by orders from
the Department; the others were shipped by me for the
cruise, and at salaries entirely disproportioned to their
services: all were volunteers. We did not sail under the
rules that govern our national ships; but we had our own
regulations, well considered and announced beforehand,
and rigidly adhered to afterward through all the vicissitudes
of the expedition. These included&mdash;first, absolute
subordination to the officer in command, or his delegate;
second, abstinence from all intoxicating liquors, except
when dispensed by special order; third, the habitual disuse
of profane language. We had no other laws.</p>

<p>All hands counted, we were eighteen at the time of
sailing. Another joined us a few days afterward; so that
the party under my command, as it reached the coast of
Greenland, consisted of&mdash;</p>

<p>Two of these, Brooks and Morton, had been my associates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
in the first expedition; gallant and trustworthy men, both
of them, as ever shared the fortunes or claimed the gratitude
of a commander.</p>

<p>The <i>Advance</i> had been thoroughly tried in many encounters
with the Arctic ice. She was carefully inspected,
and needed very little to make her all a seaman could
wish. She was a brig of one hundred and forty-four tons,
intended originally for carrying heavy castings from an
iron-foundry, but strengthened afterward with great skill
and at large expense. She was a good sailor, and easily
managed. We had five boats; one of them a metallic
life-boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Equipment</div>

<p>Our equipment consisted of little else than a quantity of
rough boards, to serve for housing over the vessel in winter,
some tents of India-rubber and canvas, of the simplest
description, and several carefully-built sledges, some of
them on a model furnished me by the kindness of the
British Admiralty, others of my own devising.</p>

<p>Our store of provisions was chosen with little regard to
luxury. We took with us some two thousand pounds of
well-made pemmican,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> a parcel of Borden&rsquo;s meat-biscuit,
some packages of an exsiccated potato, resembling Edwards&rsquo;s,
some pickled cabbage, and a liberal quantity of American
dried fruits and vegetables; besides these, we had the salt
beef and pork of the navy ration, hard biscuit, and flour.
A very moderate supply of liquors, with the ordinary <i>et
ceteras</i> of an Arctic cruiser, made up the diet-list. I hoped
to procure some fresh provisions in addition, before reaching
the upper coast of Greenland; and I carried some
barrels of malt, with a compact apparatus for brewing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> <i>Pemmican</i>, cured meat, pulverized, mixed with fat and packed
in hermetically sealed cases.</p></div>

<p>We had a moderate wardrobe of woollens, a full supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
of knives, needles, and other articles for barter, a large,
well-chosen library, and a valuable set of instruments for
scientific observations.</p>

<p>We left New York on the 30th of May 1853, escorted
by several noble steamers; and, passing slowly on to the
Narrows amid salutes and cheers of farewell, cast our brig
off from the steam-tug and put to sea.</p>

<p>It took us eighteen days to reach St John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland.
The Governor, Mr Hamilton, a brother of the
Secretary of the Admiralty, received us with a hearty
English welcome; and all the officials, indeed all the inhabitants,
vied with each other in efforts to advance our
views. I purchased here a stock of fresh beef, which, after
removing the bones and tendons, we compressed into rolls
by wrapping it closely with twine, according to the nautical
process of <i>marling</i>, and hung it up in the rigging.</p>

<p>After two days we left this thriving and hospitable city;
and, with a noble team of Newfoundland dogs on board,
the gift of Governor Hamilton, headed our brig for the
coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>We reached Baffin&rsquo;s Bay without incident. We took
deep-sea-soundings as we approached its axis, and found a
reliable depth of nineteen hundred fathoms: an interesting
result, as it shows that the ridge, which is known to extend
between Ireland and Newfoundland in the bed of the
Atlantic, is depressed as it passes further to the north. A
few days more found us off the coast of Greenland, making
our way toward Fiskernaes, the harbour of which we
entered on the 1st of July, amid the clamour of its entire
population, assembled on the rocks to greet us.</p>

<p>We found Mr Lassen, the superintending official of the
Danish Company, a hearty single-minded man, fond of
his wife, his children, and his pipe. The visit of our brig
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
was, of course, an incident to be marked in the simple
annals of his colony; and, even before I had shown him
my official letter from the Court of Denmark, he had most
hospitably proffered everything for our accommodation.
We became his guests, and interchanged presents with him
before our departure; this last transaction enabling me to
say, with confidence, that the inner fiords<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> produce noble
salmon-trout; and that the reindeer-tongue, a recognised
delicacy in the old and new Arctic continents, is justly
appreciated at Fiskernaes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> <i>Fiord</i>, an abrupt inlet of the sea.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Hans Christian</div>

<p>Feeling that our dogs would require fresh provisions,
which could hardly be spared from our supplies on shipboard,
I availed myself of Mr Lassen&rsquo;s influence to obtain
an Esquimaux hunter for our party, he recommended to
me one Hans Christian, a boy of nineteen, as an expert with
the kayack and javelin; and after Hans had given me a
touch of his quality by spearing a bird on the wing, I
engaged him. He was fat, good-natured, and, except
under the excitements of the hunt, very stolid and unimpressible.
He stipulated that, in addition to his very
moderate wages, I should leave a couple of barrels of bread
and fifty-two pounds of pork with his mother; and I
became munificent in his eyes when I added the gift of a
rifle and a new kayack. We found him very useful; our
dogs required his services as a caterer, and our own table
was more than once dependent on his energies.</p>

<p>Bidding good-bye to the governor, whose hospitality we
had shared liberally, we put to sea on Saturday, the 10th,
beating to the northward and westward in the teeth of a
gale.</p>

<p>From the time we left Fiskernaes, we had the usual
delays from fogs and adverse currents, and did not reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
the neighbourhood of Wilcox Point, which defines Melville
Bay, until the 27th of July.</p>

<p>On the 16th we passed the promontory of Swarte-huk,
and were welcomed the next day at Proven by my old
friend Christiansen, the superintendent, and found his
family much as I left them three years before. Frederick,
his son, had married a native woman, and added a summer
tent, a half-breed boy, and a Danish rifle, to his stock
of valuables. My former patient, Anna, had united fortunes
with a fat-faced Esquimaux, and was the mother of
a chubby little girl. Madame Christiansen, who counted
all these and so many others as her happy progeny, was
hearty and warm-hearted as ever. She led the household
in sewing up my skins into various serviceable garments;
and I had the satisfaction, before I left, of completing my
stock of furs for our sledge parties.</p>

<p>Coasting along, we passed in succession the Esquimaux
settlement of Kingatok, the Kettle&mdash;a mountain-top, so
named from the resemblances of its profile&mdash;and finally
Yotlik, the furthest point of colonisation; beyond which,
save the sparse headlands of the charts, the coast may be
regarded as unknown. Then, inclining more directly toward
the north, we ran close to the Baffin Islands, sighted
the landmark which is known as the Horse&rsquo;s Head, and
passing the Duck Islands, bore away for Wilcox Point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;The Bergy Hole&rdquo;</div>

<p>We stood lazily along the coast, with alternations of perfect
calm and off-shore breezes, generally from the south or
east; but on the morning of the 27th of July, as we
neared the entrance of Melville Bay, a heavy ice-fog
settled around us. We could hardly see across the decks,
and yet were sensible of the action of currents carrying us
we knew not where. By the time the sun had scattered
the mist, Wilcox Point was to the south of us; and our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
little brig, now fairly in the bay, stood a fair chance of
drifting over toward Devil&rsquo;s Thumb, which then bore east
of north. The bergs which infest this region, and which
have earned for it among the whalers the title of the &ldquo;Bergy
Hole,&rdquo; showed themselves all around us&mdash;we had come in
among them in the fog.</p>

<p>It was a whole day&rsquo;s work, towing with both boats;
but toward evening we had succeeded in crawling off
shore, and were doubly rewarded for our labour with a
wind. I had observed with surprise, while we were floating
near the coast, that the land-ice was already broken
and decayed; and I was aware, from what I had read, as
well as what I had learned from whalers and observed
myself of the peculiarities of this navigation, that the in-shore
track was in consequence beset with difficulty and
delays. I made up my mind at once. I would stand to
the westward until arrested by the pack,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and endeavour to
<i>double</i> Melville Bay by an outside passage. A chronicle
of this transit, condensed from my log-book, will interest
the reader:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 28.</i>&mdash;Born up to the northward and eastward,
heading for Cape York in tolerably free water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 29.</i>&mdash;Entered broken ice, intending to work to
the northward and eastward, above or about Sabine
Islands, in search of the north eastern land-ice. The
breeze freshened off-shore, breaking up and sending out
the floes, the leads<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> rapidly closing. Fearing a besetment,
I determined to fasten to an iceberg; and after eight
hours of very heavy labour, warping, planting
ice-anchors succeeded in effecting it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> <i>Lead</i>, a navigable opening in the ice.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;We had hardly a breathing spell, before we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
startled by a set of loud, crackling sounds above us; and
small fragments of ice, not larger than a walnut, began to
dot the water like the first drops of a summer shower.
The indications were too plain; we had barely time to
cast off, before the face of the berg fell in ruins, crashing
like artillery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our position, in the mean time, had been critical, a
gale blowing off the shore, and the floes closing and
scudding rapidly. We lost some three hundred and sixty
fathoms of whale-line, which were caught in the floes, and
had to be cut away to release us from the drift. It was a
hard night for boat-work, particularly with those of the
party who were taking their first lessons in floe<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> navigation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> <i>Floe</i>, a portion of ice detached from the main body.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 30.</i>&mdash;Again moored alongside of an iceberg.
Holding on for clearer weather. Two lively bears seen
about 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The &lsquo;Red Boat,&rsquo; with Petersen and Hayes,
got one; I took one of the quarter-boats, and shot the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 1.</i>&mdash;Beset thoroughly with drifting ice, small
rotten floe-pieces. But for our berg, we would now be
carried to the south; as it is, we drift with it to the north
and east.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the immediate danger was past; and,
espying a lead to the north-east, we got under weigh, and
pushed over in spite of the drifting trash. The men
worked with a will, and we bored through the floes in excellent
style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On our road we were favoured with a gorgeous spectacle,
which hardly any excitement of peril could have made us
overlook. The midnight sun came out over the northern
crest of the great berg, our late &ldquo;fast friend,&rdquo; kindling
variously-coloured fires on every part of its surface, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
making the ice around us one great resplendency of gem
work, blazing carbuncles, and rubies and molten gold.</p>

<p>Our brig went crunching through all this jewellery;
and, after a tortuous progress of five miles, arrested here
and there by tongues which required the saw and ice-chisels,
fitted herself neatly between two floes. Here she
rested till toward morning, when the leads opened again,
and I was able, from the crow&rsquo;s-nest, to pick our way to a
larger pool some distance ahead. In this we beat backward
and forward, like gold-fish seeking an outlet from
a glass jar, till the fog caught us again; and so the day
ended.</p>

<p>Everything now depended upon practical ice knowledge;
and, as I was not willing to trust any one else in selecting
the leads for our course, I spent the whole day with
M&rsquo;Gary at the mast-head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The North Water</div>

<p>At midnight we were clear of the bay and its myriads
of discouragements. The North Water, our highway to
Smith&rsquo;s Sound, was fairly ahead.</p>

<p>We succeeded, not without some laborious boring and
serious risks of entanglement among the broken ice-fields.
But we managed, in every instance, to combat this last
form of difficulty by attaching our vessel to large icebergs,
which enabled us to hold our own, however swiftly the
surface floes were pressing by us to the south. Four days
of this scarcely varied yet exciting navigation brought us
to the extended fields of the pack, and a fortunate north-wester
opened a passage for us through them. We were
now in the North Water.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE NORTH WATER TO THE WINTERING GROUND.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">My</span> diary continues:&mdash;&ldquo;We passed the &lsquo;Crimson Cliffs&rsquo; of
Sir John Ross in the forenoon of August 5th. The patches
of red snow, from which they derive their name, could be
seen clearly at the distance of ten miles from the coast.
It had a fine deep rose hue, and all the gorges and ravines
in which the snows had lodged were deeply tinted with it.
I had no difficulty now in justifying the somewhat poetical
nomenclature which Sir John Franklin applied to this
locality; for if the snowy surface were more diffused, as
it is no doubt, earlier in the season, crimson would be the
prevailing colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late at night we passed Conical Rock, the most
insulated and conspicuous landmark of this coast; and,
still later, Wolstenholme and Saunder&rsquo;s Islands, and
Oomenak, the place of the <i>North Star&rsquo;s</i> winter-quarters&mdash;an
admirable day&rsquo;s run; and so ends the 5th of August.
We are standing along, with studding-sails set, and open
water before us, fast nearing our scene of labour. We
have already got to work, sewing up blanket bags and
preparing sledges for our campaignings on the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached Hakluyt Island in the course of the next
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 6.</i>&mdash;Cape Alexander and Cape Isabella, the
headlands of Smith&rsquo;s Sound, are now in sight; and, in
addition to these indications of our progress toward the
field of search, a marked swell has set in after a short
blow from the northward, just such as might be looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
for from the action of the wind upon an open water-space
beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 7.</i>&mdash;We have left Cape Alexander to the
south; and Littleton Island is before us, hiding Cape
Hatherton, the latest positively-determined headland. We
are fairly inside of Smith&rsquo;s Sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we neared the west end of Littleton Island, after
breakfast this morning, I ascended to the crow&rsquo;s-nest, and
saw to my sorrow the ominous blink of ice ahead. The
wind has been freshening for a couple of days from the
northward, and if it continues, it will bring down the floes
on us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind has been made up from the first that we are
to force our way to the north, as far as the elements will
let us; and I feel the importance, therefore, of securing a
place of retreat, that in case of disaster we may not be
altogether at large. Besides, we have now reached one of
the points at which, if any one is to follow us, he might
look for some trace to guide him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Cairn</div>

<p>I determined to leave a cairn on Littleton Island, and
to deposit a boat with a supply of stores in some convenient
place near it. One of our whale-boats had been
crushed in Melville Bay, and the metallic life-boat was the
only one I could spare. Its length did not exceed twenty
feet, and our crew of twenty could hardly stow themselves
in it, with even a few days&rsquo; rations; but it was air-chambered
and buoyant.</p>

<p>Selecting from our stock of provisions and field equipage
such portions as we might by good luck be able to dispense
with, and adding with reluctant liberality some blankets
few yards of India-rubber cloth, we set out in search
of a spot for our first depôt It was essential that it
should be upon the mainland, for the rapid tides might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
so wear away the ice as to make an island inaccessible to
a foot-party; and yet it was desirable that, while secure
against the action of sea and ice, it should be approachable
by boats. We found such a place after some pretty cold
rowing. It was off the north-east cape of Littleton, and
bore S.S.E. from Cape Hatherton, which loomed in the
distance above the fog. Here were buried our life-boat
with her little cargo. We placed along her gunwale the
heaviest rocks we could handle, and, filling up the interstices
with smaller stones and sods of andromeda and
moss, poured sand and water among the layers. This,
frozen at once into a solid mass, might be hard enough,
we hoped, to resist the claws of the polar bear.</p>

<p>We found to our surprise that we were not the first
human beings who had sought a shelter in this desolate
spot. A few ruined walls here and there showed that it
had once been the seat of a rude settlement; and in the
little knoll which we cleared away to cover in our storehouse
of valuables, we found the mortal remains of their
former inhabitants.</p>

<p>Nothing can be imagined more sad and homeless than
these memorials of extinct life. Hardly a vestige of
growth was traceable on the bare ice-rubbed rocks; and
the huts resembled so much the broken fragments that
surrounded them, that at first sight it was hard to distinguish
one from the other. Walrus-bones lay about in all
directions, showing that this animal had furnished the
staple of subsistence. There were some remains, too, of
the fox and the narwhal;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> but I found no signs of the seal
or reindeer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> <i>Narwhal</i>, the sea unicorn.</p></div>

<p>These Esquimaux have no mother earth to receive their
dead, but seat them as in the attitude of repose, the knees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
drawn close to the body, and enclose them in a sack of
skins. The implements used by the person while living
are then grouped around him; they are covered with a
rude dome of stones, and a cairn is piled above. This
simple cenotaph will remain intact for generation after
generation. The Esquimaux never disturb a grave.</p>

<p>Our stores deposited, it was our next office to erect a
beacon, and intrust to it our tidings. We chose for this
purpose the Western Cape of Littleton Island, as more
conspicuous than Cape Hatherton; built our cairn; wedged
a staff into the crevices of the rocks; and, spreading the
American flag, hailed its folds with three cheers as they
expanded in the cold midnight breeze. These important
duties performed&mdash;the more lightly, let me say, for this
little flicker of enthusiasm&mdash;we rejoined the brig early on
the morning of the 7th, and forced on again towards the
north, beating against wind and tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 8.</i>&mdash;I had seen the ominous blink ahead of us
from the Flagstaff Point of Littleton Island, and before
two hours were over, we closed with ice to the westward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the evening I ventured out again with the change
of tide, but it was only to renew a profitless conflict. The
flood, encountering the southward movement of the floes,
drove them in upon the shore, and with such rapidity and
force as to carry the smaller bergs along with them. We
were too happy, when, after a manful struggle of some
hours, we found ourselves once more out of their range.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our new position was rather nearer to the south than
the one we had left. It was in a beautiful cove, land-locked
from east to west, and accessible only from the
north. Here we moored our vessel securely by hawsers to
the rocks and a whale-line carried out to the narrow
entrance. At M&rsquo;Gary&rsquo;s suggestion, I called it &lsquo;Fog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
Inlet;&lsquo; but we afterwards remembered it more thankfully
as Refuge Harbour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dogs</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 9.</i>&mdash;It may be noted among our little miseries,
that we have more than fifty dogs on board, the majority
of which might rather be characterised as &lsquo;ravening
wolves.&rsquo; To feed this family, upon whose strength our
progress and success depend, is really a difficult matter.
The absence of shore or land ice to the south in Baffin&rsquo;s
Bay has prevented our rifles from contributing any material
aid to our commissariat. Our two bears lasted the
cormorants but eight days; and to feed them upon the
meagre allowance of two pounds of raw flesh every other
day, is an almost impossible necessity. Only yesterday
they were ready to eat the caboose up, for I would not
give them pemmican. Corn-meal or beans they disdain
to touch, and salt junk would kill them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordingly I started out this morning to hunt walrus,
with which the Sound is teeming. We saw at least fifty
of these dusky monsters, and approached many groups
within twenty paces; but our rifle balls reverberated from
their hides like cork pellets from a pop-gun target, and we
could not get within harpoon-distance of one. Later in the
day, however, Ohlsen, climbing a neighbouring hill to scan
the horizon, and see if the ice had slackened, found the
dead carcass of a narwhal&mdash;a happy discovery, which has
secured for us at least six hundred pounds of good wholesome
flesh. The length of the narwhal was fourteen feet,
and his process, or &lsquo;horn,&rsquo; from the tip to its bony encasement,
four feet. We built a fire on the rocks, and melted
down his blubber; he will yield readily two barrels of oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the small hours of Wednesday morning came a
breeze from the south-west, which was followed by such
an apparent relaxation of the floes at the slack-water of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
flood-tide, that I resolved to attempt an escape from our
little basin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warping The &ldquo;Advance&rdquo;</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 12.</i>&mdash;After careful consideration, I have determined
to try for a further northing, by following the coast-line.
At certain stages of the tides&mdash;generally from three-quarters
flood to the commencement of the ebb&mdash;the ice
evidently relaxes enough to give a partial opening close
along the land. The strength of our vessel we have tested
pretty thoroughly; if she will bear the frequent groundings
that we must look for, I am persuaded we may seek these
openings, and warp along them from one lump of grounded
ice to another. The water is too shallow for ice-masses to
float in, that are heavy enough to make a nip very dangerous.
I am preparing the little brig for this novel
navigation, clearing her decks, securing things below with
extra lashings, and getting out spars, to serve in case of
necessity as shores to keep her on an even keel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 14.</i>&mdash;Change of weather yesterday tempted us
to forsake our shelter and try another tussle with the ice.
We met it as soon as we ventured out; and the day closed
with a northerly progress, by hard warping, of about
three-quarters of a mile. The men were well tired, but
the weather looked so threatening, that I had them up
again at three o&rsquo;clock this morning. My immediate aim
is to attain a low rocky island which we see close into the
shore, about a mile ahead of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Midnight.</i>&mdash;We did reach it, and just in time. At
11.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, our first whale-line was made fast to the rocks
Ten minutes later, the breeze freshened, and so directly in
our teeth that we could not have gained our mooring-ground.
It is blowing a gale now, and the ice driving to
the northward before it; but we can rely upon our hawsers.
All behind us is now solid pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 16.</i>&mdash;Fast still; the wind dying out, and the
ice outside closing steadily. And here, for all I can see,
we must hang on for the winter, unless Providence shall
send a smart ice-shattering breeze to open a road for us to
the northward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More bother with these wretched dogs! worse than a
street of Constantinople emptied upon our decks; the unruly,
thieving, wild-beast pack! Not a bear&rsquo;s paw, nor an
Esquimaux cranium, or basket of mosses, or any specimen
whatever, can leave your hands for a moment, without
their making a rush at it, and, after a yelping scramble,
swallowing it at a gulp. I have seen them attempt a
whole feather-bed; and here, this very morning, one of
my Karsuk brutes has eaten up two entire birds&rsquo;-nests,
which I had just before gathered from the rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 17.</i>&mdash;In the afternoon came a gale from the
southward. We had some rough rubbing from the floe,
pieces, with three heavy hawsers out to the rocks of our
little ice-breaker; but we held on. Toward midnight, our
six-inch line, the smallest of the three, parted, but the
other two held bravely. Feeling what good service this
island has done us, what a Godsend it was to reach her,
and how gallantly her broken rocks have protected us from
the rolling masses of ice that grind by her, we have agreed
to remember this anchorage as &lsquo;Godsend Ledge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The walrus are very numerous, approaching within
twenty feet of us, shaking their grim wet fronts, and mowing
with their tusks the sea-ripples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 19.</i>&mdash;The walrus gather around us in crowds.
I have always heard that the close approach to land of
these sphinx-faced monsters portends a storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of the Cables</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 20.</i>&mdash;By Saturday morning it blew a perfect
hurricane. We had seen it coming, and were ready with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
three good hawsers out ahead, and all things snug on
board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still it came on heavier and heavier, and the ice began
to drive more wildly than I thought I had ever seen it.
I had just turned in to warm and dry myself during a
momentary lull, and was stretching myself out in my
bunk, when I heard the sharp twanging snap of a cord.
Our six-inch hawser had parted, and we were swinging by the
two others, the gale roaring like a lion to the southward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a minute more, and &lsquo;twang, twang!&rsquo; came a
second report. I knew it was the whale-line by the shrillness
of the ring. Our ten-inch cable still held on. I was
hurrying my last sock into its seal-skin boot, when M&rsquo;Gary
cane running down the companion-ladders:&mdash;&lsquo;Captain
Kane, she won&rsquo;t hold much longer; it&rsquo;s blowing the devil
himself, and I am afraid to surge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cable was proving its excellence when I reached
the deck; and the crew, as they gathered round me, were
loud in its praises. We could hear its deep Æolian chant
swelling through all the rattle of the running-gear and
moaning of the shrouds. It was the death-song! The
strands gave way with the noise of a shotted gun; and, in
the smoke that followed their recoil, we were dragged out
by the wild ice at its mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We steadied and did some petty warping, and got the
brig a good bed in the rushing drift; but it all came to
nothing. There was now but one thing left for us&mdash;to
keep in some sort the command of the helm, by going
where we must otherwise be driven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At seven in the morning we were close upon the
piling masses. We dropped our heaviest anchor with the
desperate hope of winding the brig; but there was no
withstanding the ice-torrent that followed us. We had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
only time to fasten a spar as a buoy to the chain, and let
her slip. So went our best bower!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down we went upon the gale again, helplessly scraping
along a lee of ice seldom less than thirty feet thick; one
floe, measured by a line as we tried to fasten to it, more
than forty. I had seen such ice only once before, but
never in such rapid motion. One upturned mass rose
above our gunwale, smashing in our bulwarks, and depositing
half a ton of ice in a lump upon our decks. Our
staunch little brig bore herself through all this wild adventure
as if she had a charmed life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a new enemy came in sight ahead. Directly in
our way, just beyond the line of floe-ice against which we
were alternately sliding and thumping, was a group of
bergs. We had no power to avoid them; and the only
question was, whether we were to be dashed in pieces
against them, or whether they might not offer us some
providential nook of refuge from the storm. But, as we
neared them, we perceived that they were at some distance
from the floe-edge, and separated from it by an interval of
open water. Our hopes rose as the gale drove us toward
this passage and into it; and we were ready to exult,
when, from some unexplained cause,&mdash;probably an eddy
of the wind against the lofty ice-walls,&mdash;we lost our headway.
Almost at the same moment we saw that the bergs
were not at rest; that with a momentum of their own they
were bearing down upon the other ice, and that it must be
our fate to be crushed between the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just then a broad low water-washed berg came driving
up from the southward. The thought flashed upon me of
one of our escapes in Melville Bay; and as the sconce
moved rapidly close alongside us, M&rsquo;Gary managed to
plant an anchor on its slope and hold on to it by a whale-line.

It was an anxious moment. Our noble tow-horse,
whiter than the pale horse that seemed to be pursuing us,
hauled us bravely on, the spray dashing over his windward
flanks, and his forehead ploughing up the lesser ice as if in
scorn. The bergs encroached upon us as we advanced;
our channel narrowed to a width of perhaps forty feet; we
braced the yards to clear the impending ice-walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed clear; but it was a close shave,&mdash;so close
that our port quarter-boat would have been crushed if we
had not taken it in from the davits,&mdash;and found ourselves
under the lee of a berg, in a comparatively open lead.
Never did heart-tried men acknowledge with more gratitude
their merciful deliverance from a wretched death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day had already its full share of trials; but there
were more to come. A flaw drove us from our shelter,
and the gale soon carried us beyond the end of the lead.
We were again in the ice, sometimes escaping its onset by
warping, sometimes forced to rely on the strength and
buoyancy of the brig to stand its pressure, sometimes
scudding wildly through the half-open drift. Our jib-boom
was snapped off; we carried away our barricade
stanchions, and were forced to leave our little <i>Eric</i>,&mdash;as
our life-boat was called,&mdash;with three brave fellows and
their warps, out upon the floes behind us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Escape</div>

<p>&ldquo;A little pool of open water received us at last It
was just beyond a lofty cape that rose up like a wall, and
under an iceberg that anchored itself between us and the
gale. And here, close under the frowning shore of Greenland,
ten miles nearer the Pole than our holding-ground of
the morning, the men have turned in to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to join them, for the gale was unbroken,
and the floes kept pressing heavily upon our berg,&mdash;at one
time so heavily as to sway it on its vertical axis toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
the shore, and make its pinnacle overhang our vessel. My
poor fellows had but a precarious sleep before our little
harbour was broken up. They hardly reached the deck
when we were driven astern, and our rudder splintered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now began the nippings.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> The first shock took us on
our port-quarter, the brig bearing it well, and, after a
moment of the old-fashioned suspense, rising by jerks
handsomely. The next was from a veteran floe, tongued
and honeycombed, but floating in a single table over
twenty feet in thickness. Of course, no wood or iron could
stand this; but the shore-ward face of our iceberg happened
to present an inclined plane, descending deep into the
water; and up this the brig was driven, as if some great
power was forcing her into a dry dock.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> <i>Nip</i>, the pressing in of ice round the vessel.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;At one time I expected to see her carried bodily up its
face and tumbled over on her side. But one of those
mysterious relaxations, which I have elsewhere called the
pulses of the ice, lowered us quite gradually down again
into the rubbish, and we were forced out of the line of
pressure toward the shore. Here we succeeded in carrying
out a warp, and making fast. We grounded as the tide
fell, and would have heeled over to seaward, but for a
mass of detached land-ice that grounded alongside of us,
and, although it stove our bulwarks as we rolled over it,
shored us up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could hardly get to my bunk, as I went down into
our littered cabin on the Sunday morning after our hard-working
vigil of thirty-six hours. Bags of clothing, food,
tents, India-rubber blankets, and the hundred little personal
matters which every man likes to save in a time of trouble,
were scattered around in places where the owners thought
they might have them at hand. The pemmican had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
on deck, the boats equipped, and everything of real importance
ready for a march, many hours before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bravery of the Crew</div>

<p>During the whole of the scenes I have been trying to
describe, I could not help being struck by the composed
and manly demeanour of my comrades. The turmoil of
ice under a heavy sea often conveys the impression of
danger when the reality is absent; but in this fearful
passage, the parting of our hawsers, the loss of our anchors,
the abrupt crushing of our stoven bulwarks, and the actual
deposit of ice upon our decks, would have tried the nerves
of the most experienced ice-men. All&mdash;officers and men&mdash;worked
alike. Upon each occasion of collision with the
ice which formed our lee-coast, efforts were made to carry
out lines; and some narrow escapes were incurred by the
real of the parties leading them into positions of danger.
Mr Bonsall avoided being crushed by leaping to a floating
fragment; and no less than four of our men at one time
were carried down by the drift, and could only be recovered
by a relief party after the gale had subsided.</p>

<p>It was not until the 22d that the storm abated, and our
absent men were once more gathered back into their mess.
During the interval of forced inaction, the little brig was
fast to the ice-belt which lined the bottom of the cliffs, and
all hands rested; but as soon as it was over, we took
advantage of the flood-tide to pass our tow-lines to the ice-beach,
and, harnessing ourselves in like mules on a canal,
made a good three miles by tracking along the coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 23.</i>&mdash;We tracked along the ice-belt for about
one mile, when the tide fell, and the brig grounded, heeling
over until she reached her bearings. She rose again at 10
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and the crew turned out upon the ice-belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 24.</i>&mdash;We have kept at it, tracking along,
grounding at low water, but working like horses when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
tides allowed us to move. We are now almost at the
bottom of this indentation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are sufficiently surrounded by ice to make our
chances of escape next year uncertain, and yet not as far as
I could wish for our spring journeys by the sledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;August 26.&mdash;My officers and crew are staunch and firm
men; but the depressing influences of want of rest, the
rapid advance of winter, and, above all, our slow progress,
make them sympathize but little with this continued effort
to force a way to the north. One of them, an excellent
member of the party, volunteered an expression of opinion
this morning in favour of returning to the south and
giving up the attempt to winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is unjust for a commander to measure his subordinates
in such exigencies by his own standard. The interest
which they feel in an undertaking is of a different nature
from his own. With him there are always personal motives,
apart from official duty, to stimulate effort. He
receives, if successful, too large a share of the credit, and
he justly bears all the odium of failure.</p>

<p>An apprehension&mdash;I hope a charitable one&mdash;of this fact
leads me to consider the opinions of my officers with much
respect. I called them together at once in a formal council,
and listened to their views in full. With but one exception,
Mr Henry Brooks, they were convinced that a further
progress to the north was impossible, and were in favour
of returning southward to winter.</p>

<p>Not being able conscientiously to take the same view, I
explained to them the importance of securing a position
which might expedite our sledge journeys in the future;
and, after assuring them that such a position could only be
attained by continuing our efforts, announced my intention
of warping toward the northern headland of the bay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
&ldquo;Once there, I shall be able to determine from actual
inspection the best point for setting out on the operations
of the spring; and at the nearest possible shelter to that
point I will put the brig into winter harbour.&rdquo; My
comrades received this decision in a manner that was most
gratifying, and entered zealously upon the hard and cheerless
duty it involved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Warping</div>

<p>The warping began again, each man, myself included,
taking his turn at the capstan. The ice seemed less heavy
as we penetrated into the recess of the bay; our track-lines
and shoulder-belts replaced the warps. Hot coffee
was served out; and, in the midst of cheering songs, our
little brig moved off briskly.</p>

<p>Our success, however, was not complete. At the very
period of high-water she took the ground while close under
the walls of the ice-foot. It would have been madness to
attempt shoring her up. I could only fasten heavy tackle
to the rocks which lined the base of the cliffs, and trust to
the noble little craft&rsquo;s unassisted strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 27.</i>&mdash;We failed, in spite of our efforts, to get
the brig off with last night&rsquo;s tide; and, as our night-tides
are generally the highest, I have some apprehensions as to
her liberation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have landed everything we could get upon the rocks,
put out all our boats and filled them with portables alongside,
sunk our rudder astern, and lowered our remaining
heavy anchor into one of our quarter-boats. Heavy
hawsers are out to a grounded lump of berg-ice, ready for
instant heaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night she heeled over again so abruptly that we
were all tumbled out of our berths. At the same time the
cabin stove, with a full charge of glowing anthracite,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
thrown down. The deck blazed smartly for a while; but,
by sacrificing Mr Sontag&rsquo;s heavy pilot-cloth coat to the
public good, I choked it down till water could be passed
from above to extinguish it. It was fortunate we had
water near at hand, for the powder was not far off.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> <i>Anthracite</i>, a hard coal found in America, which burns without smoke.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;She floats again, and our track-lines are
manned. The men work with a will, and the brig moves
along bravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Aground again; and the men, after a hot
supper, have turned in to take a spell of sleep. The brig
has a hard time of it with the rocks. She has been high and
dry for each of the two last tides, and within three days
has grounded no less than five times. I feel that this is
hazardous navigation, but am convinced it is my duty to
keep on. Except the loss of a portion of our false keel,
we have sustained no real injury. The brig is still water-tight,
and her broken rudder and one shattered spar can
be easily repaired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">August 28.</span>&mdash;By a complication of purchases, jumpers,
and shores, we started the brig at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; and Mr Ohlsen
having temporarily secured the rudder, I determined to
enter the floe, and trust to the calm of the morning for a
chance of penetrating to the northern land-ice ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had now a breathing spell, and I could find time to
look out again upon the future. The broken and distorted
area around us gave little promise of successful
sledge-travel. But all this might change its aspect under
the action of a single gale, and it was by no means certain
that the ice-fields further north would have the same
rugged and dispiriting character. Besides, the ice-belt was
still before us, broken sometimes and difficult to traverse,
but practicable for a party on foot, apparently for miles
ahead; and I felt sure that a resolute boat&rsquo;s crew might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
push and track their way for some distance along it. I resolved
to make the trial, and to judge what ought to be our
wintering-ground from a personal inspection of the coast.</p>

<p>I had been quietly preparing for such an expedition for
sometime. Our best and lightest whale-boat had been
fitted with a canvas cover, that gave it all the comfort of
a tent. We had a supply of pemmican ready packed in
small cases, and a sledge taken to pieces was stowed away
under the thwarts. In the morning of the 29th, Brooks,
M&rsquo;Gary, and myself, walked fourteen miles along the marginal
ice; it was heavy and complicated with drift, but there
was nothing about it to make me change my purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Boat Crew</div>

<p>My boat-crew consisted of seven, all of them volunteers
and reliable:&mdash;Brooks, Bonsall, M&rsquo;Gary, Sontag, Riley,
Blake, and Morton. We had buffalo-robes for our sleeping-gear,
and a single extra day suit was put on board as
common property. Each man carried his girdle full of
woollen socks, so as to dry them by the warmth of his
body, and a tin cup, with a sheath-knife, at the belt; a
soup-pot and lamp for the mess completed our outfit.</p>

<p>In less than three hours from my first order, the <i>Forlorn
Hope</i> was ready for her work, covered with tin to
prevent her being cut through by the bay-ice; and at half-past
three in the afternoon she was freighted, launched,
and on her way.</p>

<p>I placed Mr Ohlsen in command of the <i>Advance</i>, and
Dr Hayes in charge of her log; Mr Ohlsen with orders to
haul the brig to the southward and eastward into a safe
berth, and there to await my return.</p>

<p>Many a warm shake of the hand from the men we left
on board showed me that our good-bye was not a mere
formality. Three hearty cheers from all hands followed us,&mdash;a
Godspeed as we pushed off.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">OUR FIRST WALK OUT&mdash;THE DEPÔT PARTY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">In</span> the first portions of our journey, we found a narrow
but obstructed passage between the ice-belt and the outside
pack. It was but a few yards in width, and the young ice
upon it was nearly thick enough to bear our weight. By
breaking it up we were able with effort to make about
seven miles a day.</p>

<p>After such work,&mdash;wet, cold, and hungry,&mdash;the night&rsquo;s
rest was very welcome. A couple of stanchions were rigged
fore and aft, a sail tightly spread over the canvas cover of
our boat, the cooking-lamp lit, and the buffalo-robes spread
out. Dry socks replaced the wet, hot tea and pemmican
followed, and very soon we forgot the discomforts of the
day,&mdash;the smokers musing over their pipes, and the sleepers
snoring in dreamless forgetfulness.</p>

<p>We had been out something less than twenty-four hours
when we came to the end of our boating. In front and on
one side was the pack, and on the other a wall some ten
feet above our heads, the impracticable ice-belt. By
waiting for high tide, and taking advantage of a chasm
which a water-stream had worn in the ice, we managed to
haul up our boat on its surface; but it was apparent that we
must leave her there. She was stowed away snugly under
the shelter of a large hummock;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> and we pushed forward in
our sledge, laden with a few articles of absolute necessity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span></p>

<p>We had to pass our sledge carefully down large gorges
in our path, winding occasionally and generally steep-sided,
and bear it upon our shoulders, wading, of course,
through water of an extremely low temperature. Our
night halts were upon knolls of snow under the rocks. At
one of these the tide overflowed our tent, and forced us to
save our buffalo sleeping-gear by holding it up until the
water subsided. This exercise, as it turned out, was more
of a trial to our patience than to our health. The circulation
was assisted perhaps by a perception of the ludicrous.
Eight Yankee Caryatides, up to their knees in water,
and an entablature sustaining such of their household gods
as could not bear immersion!</p>

<p>On the 1st of September, still following the ice-belt, we
found that we were entering the recesses of another bay
but little smaller than that in which we had left our brig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Away From Home</div>

<p>After an absence of five days, during which we made
many scientific observations of great value, we found that
we were but forty miles from the brig. Besides our small
daily progress, we had lost much by the tortuous windings
of the coast. The ice outside did not invite a change of
plan in that direction; but I determined to leave the sledge
and proceed overland on foot. With the exception of our
instruments, we carried no weight but pemmican and one
buffalo-robe. The weather, as yet not far below the
freezing-point, did not make a tent essential to the bivouac;
and, with this light equipment, we could travel readily
two miles to one with our entire outfit. On the 4th of
September we made twenty-four miles with comparative
ease, and were refreshed by a comfortable sleep after the
toils of the day.</p>

<p>The only drawback to this new method of advance was
the inability to carry a sufficient quantity of food. Each
man at starting had a fixed allowance of pemmican, which,
with his other load, made an average weight of thirty live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
pounds. It proved excessive; and we found&mdash;although
we had good walkers in our party&mdash;that a very few pounds
overweight broke us down.</p>

<p>Our progress on the 5th was arrested by another bay,
much larger than any we had seen since entering Smith&rsquo;s
Straits. It was a noble sheet of water, perfectly open,
and thus in strange contrast to the ice outside. The cause
of this, at the time inexplicable phenomenon, was found in
a roaring and tumultuous river, which, issuing from a fiord
at the inner sweep of the bay, rolled with the violence of a
snow-torrent over a broken bed of rocks. This river, the
largest probably yet known in North Greenland, was about
three-quarters of a mile wide at its mouth, and admitted
the tides for about three miles, when its bed rapidly
ascended, and could be traced by the configuration of the
hills as far as a large inner fiord. I called it Mary Minturn
River, after the sister of Mrs Henry Grinnell. Its course
was afterwards pursued to an interior glacier, from the
base of which it was found to issue in numerous streams,
that united into a single trunk about forty miles above its
mouth. By the banks of this stream we encamped, lulled
by the unusual music of running waters.</p>

<p>We forded our way across this river in the morning;
carrying our pemmican as well as we could out of water,
but submitting ourselves to a succession of plunge baths as
often as we trusted our weight on the ice-capped stones
above the surface. The average depth was not over our
hips; but the crossing cost us so much labour, that we were
willing to halt half a day to rest.</p>

<p>Leaving four of my party to recruit at this station, I
started the next morning, with three volunteers, to cross
the ice to the north-eastern headland, and thus save the
almost impossible circuit by the shores of the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span></p>

<p>We reached the headland after sixteen miles of walk,
and found the ice-foot in good condition, evidently better
fitted for sledge-travel than it was to the south. This
point I named Cape William Makepeace Thackeray.</p>

<p>I now determined to seek some high headland beyond
the cape, and make it my final point of reconnaissance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our Winter Harbour</div>

<p>I anxiously looked for, but could see no place combining
so many of the requisites of a good winter harbour as the
bay in which we left the <i>Advance</i>. Near its south-western
corner the wide streams and the water-courses on the
shore promised the earliest chances of liberation in the
coming summer. It was secure against the moving ice:
lofty headlands walled it in beautifully to seaward, enclosing
an anchorage with a moderate depth of water; yet it
open to the meridian sunlight, and guarded from
winds, eddies, and drift. The space enclosed was only
occupied by a few rocky islets and our brig. We soon
came in sight of her on our return march, as she lay at
anchor in its southern sweep, with her masts cutting
sharply against the white glacier; and, hurrying on through
a gale, we were taken on board without accident.</p>

<p>My comrades gathered anxiously around me, waiting
for the news. I told them in a few words of the results
of our journey, and why I had determined upon remaining
and gave at once the order to warp in between the islands.
We found seven fathom soundings and a perfect shelter from
outside ice; and thus laid our little brig in the harbour,
which we were fated never to leave together,&mdash;a long resting
place to her indeed, for the same ice is around her still.</p>

<p>The winter was now approaching rapidly. The thermometer
had fallen by the 10th of September to 14&deg;, and the
young ice had cemented the floes so that we could walk
and sledge round the brig. About sixty paces north of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
an iceberg had been caught, and was frozen in; it was our
neighbour while we remained in harbour. The rocky
islets around us were fringed with hummocks; and, as the
tide fell, their sides were coated with opaque crystals of
bright white. The birds had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 10.</i>&mdash;We have plenty of responsible work
before us. The long night &lsquo;when no man can work&rsquo; is
close at hand: in another month we shall lose the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, we have to unstow the hold and
deposit its contents in the storehouse on the shore. Brooks
and a party are now briskly engaged in this double labour,
running loaded boats along a canal that has to be recut
every morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next comes the catering for winter diet. We have
little or no game as yet in Smith&rsquo;s Sound; and, though
the traces of deer that we have observed may be followed
by the animals themselves, I cannot calculate upon them
as a resource. Steaks of salt junk, artistically cut, are
strung on lines and soaked in festoons under the ice. The
salmon-trout and salt cod-fish which we bought at Fiskernaes
are placed in barrels, perforated to permit a constant
circulation of fresh water through them. Our pickled
cabbage is similarly treated, after a little potash has been
used to neutralize the acid. All these are submitted to
twelve hours of alternate soaking and freezing, the crust
of ice being removed from them before each immersion.
This is the steward&rsquo;s province, and a most important one
it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one else is well employed,&mdash;M&rsquo;Gary arranging
and Bonsall making the inventory of our stores; Ohlsen
and Petersen building our deck-house; while I am devising
the plan of an architectural interior, which is to combine,
of course, the utmost ventilation, room, dryness, warmth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
general accommodation, comfort,&mdash;in a word, all the appliances
of health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have made a comfortable dog-house on the island;
but they cannot be persuaded to sleep away from the
vessel. They prefer the bare snow, where they can couch
within the sound of our voices, to a warm kennel upon
the rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 11.</i>&mdash;To-day came to us the first quiet
Sunday of harbour life. We changed our log registration
from sea-time to the familiar home series that begins at
midnight. It is not only that the season has given us
once more a local habitation; but there is something in the
return of varying day and night that makes it grateful to
reinstate this domestic observance. The long staring day,
which has clung to us for more than two months, to the
exclusion of the stars, has begun to intermit its brightness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had our accustomed morning and evening prayers;
and the day went by, full of sober thought, and, I trust,
wise resolve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fern Rock</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 12.</i>&mdash;Still going on with Saturday&rsquo;s operations,
amid the thousand discomforts of house-cleaning and
moving combined. I escaped them for an hour this morning,
to fix with Mr Sontag upon a site for our observatory;
and the men are already at work hauling the stone for it
over the ice on sledges. It is to occupy a rocky islet,
about a hundred yards off, that I have named after a little
spot that I long to see again, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Fern Rock</span>.&rsquo; This is to be
for me the centre of familiar localities. As the classic
Mivins breakfasted lightly on a cigar, and took it out in
sleep, so I have dined on salt pork and made my dessert of
dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Besides preparing our winter quarters,
I am engaged in the preliminary arrangements for my provision-depôts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
along the Greenland, coast. I purpose
arranging three of them at intervals,&mdash;pushing them as far
forward as I can,&mdash;to contain in all some twelve hundred
pounds of provision, of which eight hundred will be pemmican.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My plans of future search were directly dependent upon
the success of these operations of the autumn. With a
chain of provision-depôts along the coast of Greenland, I
could readily extend my travel by dogs. These noble
animals formed the basis of my future plans: the only
drawback to their efficiency as a means of travel was their
inability to carry the heavy loads of provender essential
for their support. A badly-fed or heavily-loaded dog is
useless for a long journey; but with relays of provision, I
could start empty, and fill up at our final station.</p>

<p>My dogs were both Esquimaux and Newfoundlanders.
Of these last I had ten: they were to be carefully broken,
to travel by voice without the whip, and were expected to
be very useful for heavy draught, as their tractability would
allow the driver to regulate their pace. I was already
training them in a light sledge to drive, unlike the Esquimaux,
two abreast, with a regular harness, a breast-collar
of flat leather, and a pair of traces. Six of them made a
powerful travelling-team; and four could carry me and my
instruments, for short journeys around the brig, with great
ease.</p>

<p>The sledge I used for them was built, with the care of
cabinet-work, of American hickory, thoroughly seasoned.
The runners were shod with annealed steel, and fastened
by copper rivets, which could be renewed at pleasure.
Except this, no metal entered into its construction. All
its parts were held together by seal-skin lashings, so that it
yielded to inequalities of surface and to sudden shock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
The three paramount considerations of lightness, strength,
and diminished friction, were well combined in it. This
beautiful, and, as we afterwards found, efficient and endurable
sledge was named the <i>Little Willie</i>.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux dogs were reserved for the great tug of
the actual journeys of search. They were now in the
semi-savage condition which marks their close approach to
the wolf; and, according to Mr Petersen, under whose care
they were placed, were totally useless for journeys, over
such ice as was now before us. A hard experience had not
then opened my eyes to the inestimable value of these
dogs: I had yet to learn their power and speed, their
patient, enduring fortitude, their sagacity in tracking
these icy morasses, among which they had been born and
bred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Faith&rdquo;</div>

<p>The men appointed to establish the depôt were furnished
with a sledge. Its model&mdash;which had been previously
tested by the adventurous journeys of M&rsquo;Clintock in Lancaster
Sound&mdash;was to lessen the height and somewhat
increase the breadth of the runner; both of which, I think,
were improvements, giving increased strength. I named
her the <i>Faith</i>. Her length was thirteen feet, and breadth
four. She could readily carry fourteen hundred pounds of
mixed stores.</p>

<p>This noble old sledge, which is now endeared to me by
every pleasant association, bore the brunt of the heaviest
parties, and came back, after the descent of the coast,
comparatively sound. The men were attached in her in
such a way as to make the line of draught or traction as
near as possible in the axis of the weight. Each man had
his own shoulder-belt, or &ldquo;rue-raddy,&rdquo; as we used to call
it, and his own track line, which, for want of horse hair,
was made of Manilla rope; it traversed freely by a ring on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
a loop or bridle, that extended from runner to runner In
front of the sledge.</p>

<p>The cargo for this journey, without including the provisions
of the party, was almost exclusively pemmican.
Some of this was put up in cylinders of tinned iron with
conical terminations, so as to resist the assaults of the
white bear; but the larger quantity was in strong wooden
cases or kegs, well hooped with iron, holding about seventy
pounds each. Surmounting this load was a light India-rubber
boat, made quite portable by a frame of basket-willow,
which I hoped to launch on reaching the open
water.</p>

<p>The personal equipment of the men was a buffalo-robe
for the party to lie upon, and a bag of Mackinaw blanket
for each man to crawl into at night. India-rubber cloth
was to be the protection from the snow beneath. The
tent was of canvas, made after the plan of our English
predecessors. We afterward learned to modify and reduce
our travelling gear, and found that in direct proportion to
its simplicity and our apparent privation of articles of
supposed necessity, were our actual comfort and practical
efficiency. Step by step, as long as our Arctic service
continued, we went on reducing our sledging outfit, until
at last we came to the Esquimaux ultimatum of simplicity&mdash;raw
meat and a fur bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 20.</i>&mdash;I was unwilling to delay my depôt
party any longer. M&rsquo;Gary and Bonsall, with five men,
left the brig at half-past one to-day. We gave them three
cheers, and I accompanied them with my dogs, as a farewell
escort, for some miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our crew proper is now reduced to three men; but all
the officers, the doctor among the rest, are hard at work
upon the observatory and its arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">DOMESTIC TROUBLES&mdash;RETURN OF THE DEPÔT PARTY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> island on which we placed our observatory was some
fifty paces long by perhaps forty broad, and about thirty
feet above the water-line. Here we mounted our transit
and theodolite.</p>

<p>The magnetic observatory adjoined, and had rather more
of the affectation of comfort. No iron was used in its
construction. Here were our magnetometer and dip instruments;
and the tide-register was placed on board the
vessel.</p>

<p>Our meteorological observatory was upon the open ice-field,
one hundred and forty yards from the ship. It was a
wooden structure, latticed and pierced with augur-holes on
all sides, so as to allow the air to pass freely, and firmly
luted to its frozen base. This was well supplied with
thermometers of all varieties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 30.</i>&mdash;We have been terribly annoyed by rats.
Some days ago we made a brave effort to smoke them out
with the vilest imaginable compound of vapours,&mdash;brimstone,
burnt leather, and arsenic,&mdash;and spent a cold night
in a deck-bivouac, to give the experiment fair play. But
they survived the fumigation. We now determined to
dose them with carbonic acid gas. Dr Hayes burnt a
quantity of charcoal; and we shut down the hatches, after
closing up every fissure that communicated aft, and starting
three stoves on the skin of the forepeak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the gas was generated with extreme rapidity in the
confined area below, great caution had to be exercised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
Our French cook, good Pierre Schubert,&mdash;who to a considerable
share of bull-headed intrepidity unites a commendable
portion of professional zeal,&mdash;stole below, without
my knowledge or consent, to season a soup. Morton
fortunately saw him staggering in the dark, and, reaching
him with great difficulty as he fell, both were hauled up in
the end,&mdash;Morton, his strength almost gone, and the cook
perfectly insensible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fire on Board Ship</div>

<p>&ldquo;The next disaster was of a graver sort. I record it
with emotions of mingled awe and thankfulness. We
have narrowly escaped being burnt out of house and home.
I had given orders that the fires, lit under my own eye,
should be regularly inspected; but I learned that Pierre&rsquo;s
misadventure had made the watch pretermit for a time
opening the hatches. As I lowered a lantern, which was
extinguished instantly, a suspicious odour reached me, as
of burning wood. I descended at once. Reaching the
deck of the forecastle, my first glance toward the fires
showed me that all was safe there; and, though the quantity
of smoke still surprised me, I was disposed to attribute
it to the recent kindling. But at this moment, while
passing on my return near the door of the bulkhead, which
leads to the carpenter&rsquo;s room, the gas began to affect me.
My lantern went out as if quenched by water; and, as I
ran by the bulkhead door, I saw the deck near it a mass of
glowing fire for some three feet in diameter. I could not
tell how much further it extended, for I became quite
insensible at the foot of the ladder, and would have sunk,
had not Mr Brooks seen my condition and hauled me out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came to myself, which happily was very soon,
I confided my fearful secret to the four men around me,
Brooks, Ohlsen, Blake, and Stevenson. It was all important
to avoid confusion: we shut the doors of the galley, so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
to confine the rest of the crew and officers aft, and then
passed up water from the fire-hole alongside. It was all
done very quietly. Ohlsen and myself went down to the
burning deck; Brooks handed us in the buckets; and in
less than ten minutes we were in safety. We found the
fire had originated in the remains of a barrel of charcoal,
which had been left in the carpenter&rsquo;s room, ten feet from
the stoves, and with a bulkhead separating it from them.
How it had been ignited it was impossible to know. Our
safety was due to the dense charge of carbonic acid gas
which surrounded the fire, and the exclusion of atmospheric
air. When the hatches were opened the flame burst out
with energy. Our fire-hole was invaluable; and I rejoiced
that, in the midst of our heavy duties, this essential of an
Arctic winter harbour had not been neglected. The ice
around the brig was already fourteen inches thick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Upon inspecting the scene of yesterday&rsquo;s
operations, we found twenty-eight well-fed rats of all
varieties of age. The cook, though unable to do duty, is
better; I can hear him chanting his Béranger through the
blankets in his bunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 3.</i>&mdash;On shore to the south-east, above the first
terrace, Mr Petersen found unmistakable signs of a sledge-passage.
The tracks were deeply impressed, but certainly
more than one season old. This adds to our hope that the
natives, whose ancient traces we saw on the point south of
Godsend Ledge, may return this winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;October 5.&mdash;A circumstance that happened to-day is of
serious concern to us. Our dogs have been adding to our
stock. We have now on hand four reserved puppies of
peculiar promise; six have been ignominiously drowned,
two devoted to a pair of mittens for Dr Kane, and seven
eaten by their mammas. Yesterday the mother of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
batch, a pair of fine white pups, showed peculiar symptoms.
We recalled the fact that for days she had avoided water,
or had drunk with spasms and evident aversion; but
hydrophobia, which is unknown north of 70&deg;, never occurred
to us. The animal was noticed this morning walking up
and down the deck with a staggering gait, her head depressed,
and her mouth frothing and tumid. Finally she
snapped at Petersen, and fell foaming and biting at his
feet. He reluctantly pronounced it hydrophobia, and
advised me to shoot her. The advice was well-timed: I
had hardly cleared the deck before she snapped at Hans,
the Esquimaux, and recommenced her walking trot. It
was quite an anxious moment to me; for my Newfoundlanders
were around the housing, and the hatches open.
We shot her, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 8.</i>&mdash;I have been practising with my dog-sledge
and an Esquimaux team till my arms ache. To drive such
an equipage, a certain proficiency with the whip is indispensable;
which, like all proficiency, must be worked for.
In fact, the weapon has an exercise of its own, quite peculiar,
and is as hard to learn as single-stick or broadsword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 10.</i>&mdash;Our depôt party has been out twenty days,
and it is time they were back: their provisions must have
run very low, for I enjoined them to leave every pound at
the depôt they could spare. I am going out with supplies
to look after them. I take four of our best Newfoundlanders,
now well broken, in our lightest sledge; and Blake
will accompany me with his skates. We have not hands
enough to equip a sledge party, and the ice is too unsound
for us to attempt to ride with a large team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My first effort was, of course, to reach the land; but it
was unfortunately low tide, and the ice-belt rose up before
me like a wall. The pack was becoming more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
unsafe, and I was extremely anxious to gain an asylum on
shore; for, though it was easy to find a temporary refuge
by retreating to the old floes which studded the more
recent ice, I knew that in doing so we should risk being
carried down by the drift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accident to the Dogs</div>

<p>The dogs began to flag; but we had to press them;&mdash;we
were only two men; and, in the event of the animals failing
to leap any of the rapidly-multiplying fissures, we could
hardly expect to extricate our laden sledge. Three times,
in less than three hours, my shaft or hinder dogs went in;
and John and myself, who had been trotting alongside the
sledge for sixteen miles were nearly as tired as they were.
This state of things could not last; and I therefore made
for the old ice to seaward.</p>

<p>We were nearing it rapidly, when the dogs failed in
leaping a chasm that was somewhat wider than the others
and the whole concern came down in the water. I cut the
lines instantly, and, with the aid of my companion, hauled
the poor animals out. We owed the preservation of the
sledge to their admirable docility and perseverance. The
tin-cooking apparatus and the air confined in the India-rubber
coverings kept it afloat till we could succeed in
fastening a couple of seal-skin cords to the cross-pieces at
the front and back. By these John and myself were able
to give it an uncertain support from the two edges of the
opening, till the dogs, after many fruitless struggles, carried
it forward at last upon the ice.</p>

<p>Although the thermometer was below zero, and in our
wet state we ran considerable risk of freezing, the urgency
of our position left no room for thoughts of cold. We
started at a run, men and dogs, for the solid ice; and by
the time we had gained it we were steaming in the cold
atmosphere like a couple of vapour-baths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span></p>

<p>We rested on the floe. We could not raise our tent, for
it had frozen hard. But our buffalo-robe bags gave us
protection; and, though we were too wet inside to be
absolutely comfortable, we managed to get something like
sleep before it was light enough for us to move on again.</p>

<p>The journey was continued in the same way for a few
days; but we found, to our great gratification, that the
cracks closed with the change of the tide, and at high-water
we succeeded in gaining the ice-belt under the cliffs.</p>

<p>Our progress averaged twenty miles a day since leaving
the brig, and we were within a short march of the cape which
I have named William Wood, when a broad chasm brought
us to a halt. It was in vain that we worked out to seaward,
or dived into the shore-ward recesses of the bay: the
ice everywhere presented the same impassable fissures.
We had no alternative but to retrace our steps and seek
among the bergs some place of security. We found a camp
for the night on the old floe-ices to the westward, gaining
them some time after the darkness had closed in.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, about two hours before the
late sunrise, as I was preparing to climb a berg from which
I might have a sight of the road ahead, I perceived far off
upon the white snow a dark object, which not only moved,
but altered its shape strangely,&mdash;now expanding into a
long black line, now waving, now gathering itself up into
a compact mass. It was the returning sledge party. They
had seen our black tent, and ferried across to seek it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of the Wanderers</div>

<p>They were most welcome; for their absence, in the fearfully
open state of the ice, had filled me with apprehensions.
We could not distinguish each other as we drew near in the
twilight; and my first good news of them was when I
heard that they were singing. On they came, and at last
I was able to count their voices, one by one. Thank God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
seven! Poor John Blake was so breathless with gratulation,
that I could not get him to blow his signal-horn.
We gave them, instead, the good old English greeting,
&ldquo;three cheers!&rdquo; and in a few minutes were among them.</p>

<p>They had made a creditable journey, and were, on the
whole, in good condition. They had no injuries worth talking
about, although not a man had escaped some touches
of the frost. Bonsall was <i>minus</i> a big toe-nail, and <i>plus</i> a
scar upon the nose. M&rsquo;Gary had attempted, as Tom
Hickey had told us, to pluck a fox, it being so frozen as to
defy skinning by his knife; and his fingers had been
tolerably frost-bitten in the operation. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very
horny, sir, are my fingers,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Gary, who was worn
down to a mere shadow of his former rotundity; &ldquo;very
horny, and they water up like bladders.&rdquo; The rest had
suffered in their feet; but, like good fellows, postponed
limping until they reached the ship.</p>

<p>Within the last three days they had marched fifty-four
miles. Their sledge being empty, and the young ice north
of Cape Bancroft smooth as a mirror, they had travelled,
the day before we met them, nearly twenty-five miles. A
very remarkable pace for men who had been twenty-eight
days in the field.</p>

<p>My supplies of hot food, coffee, and marled beef soup,
which I had brought with me, were very opportune. They
had almost exhausted their bread; and, being unwilling to
encroach on the depôt stores, had gone without fuel in
order to save alcohol. Leaving orders to place my own
sledge stores in <i>cache</i>, I returned to the brig, ahead of the
party, with my dog sledge, carrying Mr Bonsall with me.</p>

<p>This extract from the journal shows how the men fared
on reaching the brig:&mdash;&ldquo;&ldquo;The spar-deck&mdash;or, as we call it
from its wooden covering, the &lsquo;house&rsquo;&mdash;is steaming with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
the buffalo-robes, tents, boots, socks, and heterogeneous
costumings of our returned parties. We have ample work
in repairing these and restoring the disturbed order of our
domestic Life. The men feel the effects of their journey,
but are very content in their comfortable quarters. A
pack of cards, grog at dinner, and the promise of a three
days&rsquo; holiday, have made the decks happy with idleness
and laughter.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">OUR FIRST WINTER.</p>


<p class="p0">&ldquo;<i>November 7.</i>&mdash;The darkness is coming on with insidious
steadiness, and its advances can only be perceived by comparing
one day with its fellow of some time back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except upon the island of Spitzbergen, which has the
advantages of an insular climate and tempered by ocean
currents, no Christians have wintered in so high a latitude
as this. They are Russian sailors who make the encounter
there, men inured to hardships and cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 9.</i>&mdash;Wishing to get the altitude of the cliffs
on the south-west cape of our bay before the darkness set
in thoroughly, I started in time to reach them with my
Newfoundlanders at noonday. Although it was but a
short journey, the rough shore-ice and a slight wind
rendered the cold severe. I had been housed for a week
with my wretched rheumatism, and felt that daily exposure
was necessary to enable me to bear up against the cold.
The thermometer indicated 23&deg; below zero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 16.</i>&mdash;The great difficulty is to keep up a
cheery tone among the men. Poor Hans has been sorely
home-sick. Three days ago he bundled up his clothes and
took his rifle, to bid us all good-bye. It turns out that
besides his mother there is another of the softer sex at
Fiskernaes that the boy&rsquo;s heart is dreaming of. He looked
as wretched as any lover of a milder clime. I hope I have
treated his nostalgia successfully, by giving him first a dose
of salts, and secondly, promotion. He has now all the
dignity of a henchman. He harnesses my dogs, builds my
traps, and walks with me on my ice-tramps; and, except
hunting, is excused from all other duty. He is ready
attached to me, and as happy as a fat man might to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A &ldquo;Fox Chase&rdquo;</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 22.</i>&mdash;I offered a prize to-day of a Guernsey
shirt to the man who held out longest in a &lsquo;fox chase&rsquo;
round the decks. The rule of the sport was, that &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;
was to run a given circuit between galley and capstan, all
hands following on his track; every four minutes a halt to
be called to blow, and the fox making the longest run to
take the prize; each of the crew to run as fox in turn.
William Godfrey sustained the chase for fourteen minutes,
and <i>wore</i> off the shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 27.</i>&mdash;I sent out a volunteer party some days
ago with Mr Bonsall, to see whether the Esquimaux have
returned to the huts we saw empty at the cape. The
thermometer was in the neighbourhood of 40&deg; below zero,
and the day was too dark to read at noon. I was hardly
surprised when they returned after camping one night
upon the snow. Their sledge broke down, and they were
obliged to leave tents and everything else behind them.
It must have been very cold, for a bottle of Monongahela
whisky of good stiff proof froze under Mr Bonsall&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morton went out on Friday to reclaim the things they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
had left, and to-day at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> he returned successful. He
reached the wreck of the former party, making nine miles
in three hours,&mdash;pushed on six miles further on the ice-foot,&mdash;then
camped for the night; and, making a sturdy
march the nest day without luggage, reached the huts, and
got back to his camp to sleep. This journey of his was,
we then thought, really an achievement,&mdash;sixty-two miles
in three marches, with a mean temperature of 40&deg; below
zero, and a noonday so dark that you could hardly see a
hummock of ice fifty paces ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under more favouring circumstances, Bonsall, Morton,
and myself made eighty-four miles in three consecutive
marches. I go for the system of forced marches on
journeys that are not over a hundred and fifty miles. A
practised walker unencumbered by weight does twenty miles
a day nearly as easily as ten: it is the uncomfortable sleeping
that wears a party out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 12.</i>&mdash;A grand incident in our great monotony
of life! We had an occultation of Saturn at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and got a most satisfactory observation. The emersion
was obtained with greater accuracy than could have been
expected from the excessive atmospheric undulation of
these low temperatures. My little Fraunhöfer sustained
its reputation well. We can now fix our position without
a cavil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 15.</i>&mdash;We have lost the last vestige of our
mid-day twilight. We cannot see print, and hardly paper
the fingers cannot be counted a foot from the eyes. Noonday
and midnight are alike, and, except a vague glimmer
on the sky that seems to define the hill outlines to the
south, we have nothing to tell us that this Arctic world of
ours has a sun. In one week more we shall reach the
midnight of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Old Grim</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 22.</i>&mdash;There is an excitement in our little
community that dispenses with reflections upon the solstitial
night. &lsquo;Old Grim&rsquo; is missing, and has been for more
than a day. Since the lamented demise of Cerberus, my
leading Newfoundlander, he has been patriarch of our
scanty kennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Grim was a &lsquo;character&rsquo; such as peradventure may
at some time be found among beings of a higher order and
under a more temperate sky. A profound hypocrite and
time-server, he so wriggled his adulatory tail as to secure
every one&rsquo;s good graces and nobody&rsquo;s respect. All the
spare morsels, the cast-off delicacies of the mess, passed
through the winnowing jaws of &lsquo;Old Grim,&rsquo;&mdash;an illustration
not so much of his eclecticism as his universality of
taste. He was never known to refuse anything offered or
approachable, and never known to be satisfied, however
prolonged and abundant the bounty or the spoil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grim was an ancient dog: his teeth indicated many
winters; and his limbs, once splendid tractors for the
sledge, were now covered with warts and ringbones. Somehow
or other, when the dogs were harnessing for a journey,
&lsquo;Old Grim&rsquo; was sure not to be found; and upon one
occasion, when he was detected hiding away in a cast-off
barrel, he incontinently became lame. Strange to say, he
has been lame ever since, except when the team is away
without him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold disagrees with Grim; but by a system of patient
watchings at the door of our deck-house, accompanied by
a discriminating use of his tail, he became at last the one
privileged intruder. My seal-skin coat has been his
favourite bed for weeks together. Whatever love for an
individual Grim expressed by his tail, he could never be
induced to follow him on the ice after the cold darkness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
the winter set in; yet the dear, good old sinner would
wriggle after you to the very threshold of the gangway,
and bid you good-bye with a deprecatory wag of the tail
which disarmed resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His appearance was quite characteristic: his muzzle
roofed like the old-fashioned gable of a Dutch garret-window;
his forehead indicating the most meagre capacity
of brains that could consist with his sanity as a dog; his
eyes small, his mouth curtained by long black dewlaps,
and his hide a mangy russet studded with chestnut-burrs;
if he has gone indeed, we &lsquo;ne&rsquo;er shall look upon his like
again.&rsquo; So much for old Grim!</p>

<p>&ldquo;When yesterday&rsquo;s party started to take soundings, I
thought the exercise would benefit Grim, whose time-serving
sojourn on our warm deck had begun to render
him over-corpulent. A rope was fastened round him, for
at such critical periods he was obstinate, and even ferocious;
and, thus fastened to the sledge, he commenced his
reluctant journey. Reaching a stopping-place after a while,
he jerked upon his line, parted it a foot or two from its
knot, and, dragging the remnant behind him, started off
through the darkness in the direction of our brig. He has
not been seen since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 23.</i>&mdash;Our anxieties for old Grim might have
interfered with almost anything else; but they could not
arrest our celebration of yesterday. Dr Hayes made us a
well-studied oration, and Morton a capital punch; add to
these a dinner of marled beef,&mdash;we have two pieces left,
for the sun&rsquo;s return and the 4th of July,&mdash;and a bumper of
champagne all round; and the elements of our frolic are
all registered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tracked old Grim to-day through the snow to
within six hundred yards of the brig, and thence to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
mass of snow-packed sterility which we call the shore.
His not rejoining the ship is a mystery quite in keeping
with his character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My journal for the first two months of 1854 is so devoid
of interest, that I spare the reader the task of following
me through it. In the darkness and consequent
inaction, as it was almost in vain that we sought to create
topics of thought, and by a forced excitement to ward off
the encroachments of disease. Our observatory and the
dogs gave us our only regular occupations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Returning Light</div>

<p>The first traces of returning light were observed at noon
on the 21st of January, when the southern horizon had for
a short time a distinct orange tint. Though the sun had
perhaps given us a band of illumination before, it was not
distinguishable from the cold light of the planets.</p>

<p>The influence of this long, intense darkness was most
depressing. Even our dogs, although the greater part of
them were natives of the Arctic Circle, were unable to
withstand it. Most of them died from an anomalous form
of disease, to which, I am satisfied, the absence of light
contributed as much as the extreme cold. I give a little
extract from my journal of January 20:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning at five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;for I am so afflicted with
the insomnium of this eternal night, that I rise at any time
between midnight and noon&mdash;I went upon deck. It was
absolutely dark; the cold not permitting a swinging lamp.
There was not a glimmer came to me through the ice-crusted
window-panes of the cabin. While I was feeling
my way, half puzzled as to the best method of steering
clear of whatever might be before me, two of my Newfoundland
dogs put their cold noses against my hand, and
instantly commenced the most exuberant antics of satisfaction.
It then occurred to me how very dreary and forlorn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
must these poor animals be, at atmospheres 10&deg; indoors
and 50&deg; without,&mdash;living in darkness, howling at
an accidental light, as if it reminded them of the moon,&mdash;and
with nothing, either of instinct or sensation, to tell
them of the passing hours, or to explain the long-lost daylight.
They shall see the lanterns more frequently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>January 25.</i>&mdash;The mouse-coloured dogs, the leaders
of my Newfoundland team, have for the past fortnight
been nursed like babies. No one can tell how anxiously
I watch them. They are kept below, tended, fed, cleansed,
caressed, and doctored, to the infinite discomfort of all
hands. To-day I give up the last hope of saving them.
Their disease is as clearly mental as in the case of any
human being. The more material functions of the poor
brutes go on without interruption: they eat voraciously,
retain their strength, and sleep well. But all the indications
beyond this go to prove that the original epilepsy,
which was the first manifestation of brain disease among
them, has been followed by a true lunacy. They bark
frenziedly at nothing, and walk in straight and curved
lines with anxious and unwearying perseverance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 22d, I took my first walk on the great floe, which
had been so long a time a crude, black labyrinth. I give
the appearance of things in the words of my journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The floe has changed wonderfully. I remember it
sixty-four days ago, when our twilight was as it now is, a
partially snow-patched plain, chequered with ridges of
sharp hummocks, or a series of long icy levels, over which
I coursed with my Newfoundlanders. All this has gone.
A lead-coloured expanse stretches its &lsquo;rounding grey&rsquo; in
every direction, and the old angular hummocks are so
softened down as to blend in rolling dunes with distant
obscurity. The snow upon the levels shows the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
remarkable evaporation. It is now in crisp layers, hardly
six inches thick, quite undisturbed by drift. I could
hardly recognise any of the old localities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I close my notice of these dreary months with a single
extract more. The date of it is February 21st.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had the sun for some days silvering the ice
between the headlands of the bay; and to-day, toward
noon, I started out to be the first of my party to welcome
him back. It was the longest walk and toughest climb
that I have had since our imprisonment; and scurvy and
general debility have made me &lsquo;short o&rsquo; wind.&rsquo; But I
managed to attain my object. I saw him once more; and
upon a projecting crag nestled in the sunshine. It was like
bathing in perfumed water.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of the Crew</div>

<p>The month of March brought back to us the perpetual
day. The sunshine had reached our deck on the last day
of February; we needed it to cheer us. We were not as
pale as my experience in Lancaster Sound had foretold,
but the scurvy-spots that mottled our faces gave sore proof
of the trials we had undergone. It was plain that we were
all of us unfit for arduous travel on foot at the intense temperatures
of the nominal spring; and the return of the sun,
by increasing the evaporation from the floes, threatened us
with a recurrence of still severer weather.</p>

<p>But I felt that our work was unfinished. The great
object of the expedition challenged us to a more northward
exploration. My dogs, that I had counted on so largely,
the nine splendid Newfoundlanders and thirty-five Esquimaux
of six months before, had perished; there were only
six survivors of the whole pack, and one of these was unfit
for draught. Still, they formed my principal reliance, and
I busied myself from the very beginning of the month in
training them to run together. The carpenter was set to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
work upon a small sledge, on an improved model, and
adapted to the reduced force of our team; and, as we had
exhausted our stock of small cord to lash its parts together,
Mr Brooks rigged up a miniature rope-walk, and was preparing
a new supply from part of the material of our deep-sea
lines. The operations of shipboard, however, went on
regularly; Hans, and occasionally Petersen, going out on
the hunt, though rarely returning successful.</p>

<p>The reader may be disposed to wonder how we got
through our long dark night. It was certainly very dull;
and the following account of one day will convey a very
good idea of the whole season:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At six in the morning M&rsquo;Gary is called, with all hands
who have <i>slept in</i>. The decks are cleaned, the ice-hole
opened, the refreshing beef-nets examined, the ice-tables
measured, and things aboard put to rights. At half-past
seven all hands rise, wash on deck, open the doors for
ventilation, and come below for breakfast. We are short
of fuel and therefore cook in the cabin. Our breakfast,
for all fare alike, is hard tack, pork, stewed apples frozen
like molasses-candy, tea and coffee, with a delicate portion
of raw potato. After breakfast the smokers take their
pipe till nine; then all hands turn to, idlers to idle and
workers to work; Ohlsen to his bench, Brooks to his &lsquo;preparations&rsquo;
in canvas, M&rsquo;Gary to play tailor, Whipple to
make shoes, Bonsall to tinker, Baker to skin birds, and the
rest to the &lsquo;Office!&rsquo; Take a look into the Arctic bureau!
One table, one salt-pork lamp with rusty chlorinated flame,
three stools, and as many waxen-faced men with their legs
drawn up under them, the deck at zero being too cold for
the feet. Each has his department: Kane is writing,
sketching, and projecting maps; Hayes copying logs and
meteorologicals; Sontag reducing his work at Fern Rock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
A fourth, as one of the working members of the hive, has
long been defunct; you will find him in bed. At twelve a
business round of inspection, and orders enough to fill up
the day with work. Next, the drill of the Esquimaux dogs&mdash;my
own peculiar recreation&mdash;a dog-trot specially refreshing
to legs that creak with every kick, and rheumatic
shoulders that chronicle every descent of the whip. And
so we get on to dinner-time&mdash;the occasion of another
gathering, which misses the tea and coffee of breakfast,
but rejoices in pickled cabbage and dried peaches
instead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Raw Potato</div>

<p>&ldquo;At dinner, as at breakfast, the raw potato comes in, our
hygienic luxury. Like doctor-stuff generally, it is not as
appetising as desirable. Grating it down nicely, leaving
out the ugly red spots liberally, and adding the utmost oil
as a lubricant, it is as much as I can do to persuade the
mess to shut their eyes and bolt it, like Mrs Squeers&rsquo;
molasses and brimstone at Dotheboys Hall. Two absolutely
refuse to taste it. I tell them of the Silesians
using its leaves as spinach, of the whalers in the South
Seas getting drunk on the molasses which had preserved
the large potatoes of the Azores&mdash;I point to this gum, so
fungoid and angry the day before yesterday, and so flat and
amiable to-day&mdash;all by a potato poultice; my eloquence is
wasted; they persevere in rejecting the admirable compound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep, exercise, amusement, and work at will, carry on
the day till our six o&rsquo;clock supper, a meal something like
breakfast and something like dinner, only a little more
scant; and the officers come in with the reports of the day.
Dr Hayes shows me the log, I sign it; Sontag the weather,
I sign the weather; Mr Bonsall the tides and thermometers.
Thereupon comes in mine ancient, Brooks; and I enter in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
his journal all the work done under his charge, and discuss
his labours for the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Gary comes next, with the cleaning-up arrangement,
inside, outside, and on decks; and Mr Wilson follows with
ice-measurements. And last of all comes my own record
of the day gone by; every line, as I look back upon its
pages, giving evidence of a weakened body and harassed
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile we talked encouragingly of spring hopes and
summer prospects, and managed sometimes to force an
occasion for mirth out of the very discomforts of our unyielding
winter life.</p>

<p>This may explain the tone of my diary.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">AN ANXIOUS SEARCH.</p>


<p class="p0">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Not</span> a man now, except Pierre and Morton, is exempt
from scurvy; and, as I look around upon the pale faces
and haggard looks of my comrades, I feel that we are
fighting the battle of life at disadvantage, and that an
Arctic night and an Arctic day age a man more rapidly and
harshly than a year anywhere else in all this weary world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 13.</i>&mdash;Since January, we have been working at
the sledges and other preparations for travel. The death
of my dogs, the rugged obstacles of the ice, and the intense
cold, have obliged me to reorganise our whole equipment.
We have had to discard all our India-rubber fancy-work;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
canvas shoe-making, fur-socking, sewing, carpentering, are
all going on; and the cabin, our only fire-warmed apartment,
is the workshop, kitchen, parlour, and hall. Pemmican cases
are thawing on the lockers; buffalo-robes are drying around
the stove; camp equipments occupy the corners; and our
woe-begone French cook, with an infinitude of useless
saucepans, insists on monopolising the stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 17.</i>&mdash;It is nine o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and the thermometer
outside at -46&deg;. I am anxious to have my depôt
party off; but I must wait until there is a promise of
milder weather. It must come soon. The sun is almost
at the equator. On deck, I can see to the northward
all the bright glare of sunset, streaming out in long bands
of orange through the vapours of the ice-foot, and the frost-smoke
exhaling in wreaths like those from the house-chimneys
a man sees in the valleys as he comes down a
mountain side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Start of the Depôt Party</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 18.</i>&mdash;To-day our spring-tides gave to the massive
ice which sustains our little vessel a rise and fall of
seventeen feet. The crunching and grinding, the dashing
of the water, the gurgling of the eddies, and the toppling
over of the nicely-poised ice-tables, were unlike the more
brisk dynamics of hummock action, but conveyed a more
striking expression of power and dimension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thermometer at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning was
-49&deg;; too cold still, I fear, for our sledgemen to set
out. But we packed the sledge and strapped on the boat,
determined to see how she would drag. Eight nun
attached themselves to the lines, but were scarcely able to
move her. This may be due in part to an increase of
friction produced by the excessive cold, according to
experience of the Siberian travellers; but I have no
doubt it is principally caused by the very thin runners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
of our Esquimaux sledge cutting through the snow-crust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The excessive refraction this evening, which entirely
lifted up the northern coast as well as the icebergs, seems
to give the promise of milder weather. In the hope that
it may be so, I have fixed on to-morrow for the departure
of the sledge, after very reluctantly dispensing with more
than two hundred pounds of her cargo, besides the boat.
The party think they can get along with it now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 20.</i>&mdash;I saw the depôt party off yesterday. They
gave the usual three cheers, with three for myself. I gave
them the whole of my brother&rsquo;s great wedding-cake and
my last two bottles of Port, and they pulled the sledge
they were harnessed to famously. But I was not satisfied.
I could see it was hard work; and, besides, they were
without the boat, or enough extra pemmican to make their
deposit of importance. I followed them, therefore, and
found that they encamped at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> only five miles from
the brig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I overtook them I said nothing to discourage
them, and gave no new orders for the morning; but after
laughing at good Ohlsen&rsquo;s rueful face, and listening to all
Petersen&rsquo;s assurances that the cold and nothing but the
cold retarded his Greenland sledge, and that no sledge of
any other construction could have been moved at all
through -40&deg; snow, I quietly bade them good-night, leaving
all hands under their buffaloes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once returned to the brig, all my tired remainder-men
were summoned; a large sled with broad runners, which I
had built somewhat after the neat Admiralty model sent
me by Sir Francis Beaufort, was taken down, scraped,
polished, lashed, and fitted with track-ropes and <i>rue-raddies</i>&mdash;the
lines arranged to draw as near as possible in a line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
with the centre of gravity. We made an entire cover of
canvas, with snugly-adjusted fastenings; and by one in the
morning we had our discarded excess of pemmican and the
boat once more in stowage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rescue</div>

<p>&ldquo;Off we went for the camp of the sleepers. It was very
cold, but a thoroughly Arctic night&mdash;the snow just tinged
with the crimson stratus above the sun, which, equinoctial
as it was, glared beneath the northern horizon like a
smelting-furnace. We found the tent of the party by the
bearings of the stranded bergs. Quietly and stealthily we
hauled away their Esquimaux sledge, and placed her cargo
upon the <i>Faith</i>. Five men were then &lsquo;rue-raddied&rsquo; to the
track-lines, and with the whispered word, &lsquo;Now, boys,
when Mr Brooks gives his third snore, off with you!&rsquo; off
they went, and the <i>Faith</i> after them, as free and nimble as
a volunteer. The trial was a triumph. We awakened the
sleepers with three cheers; and, giving them a second
good-bye, returned to the brig, carrying the dishonoured
vehicle along with us. And now, barring mishaps past
anticipation, I shall have a depôt for my long trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The party were seen by M&rsquo;Gary from aloft, at noon to-day,
moving easily, and about twelve miles from the brig.
The temperature too is rising, or rather unmistakably about
to rise. Our lowest was -43&deg;, but our highest reached
-22&deg;; this extreme range, with the excessive refraction
and a gentle misty air from about the south-east, makes
me hope that we are going to have a warm spell. The
party is well off. Now for my own to follow them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 21.</i>&mdash;All hands at work house-cleaning. Thermometer
-18&deg;. Visited the fox-traps with Hans in the
afternoon, and found one poor animal frozen dead. A
hard thing about his fate was that he had succeeded in
effecting his escape from the trap, but, while working his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
way underneath, had been frozen fast to a smooth stone by
the moisture of his own breath. He was not probably
aware of it before the moment when he sought to avail himself
of his hard-gained liberty. These saddening thoughts
did not impair my appetite at supper, where the little creature
looked handsomer than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 22.</i>&mdash;We took down the forward bulkhead to-day,
and moved the men aft, to save fuel. All hands are
still at work clearing up the decks, the scrapers sounding
overhead, and the hickory-brooms crackling against the
frozen woodwork. Afternoon comes, and M&rsquo;Gary brings
from the traps two foxes, a blue and a white. Afternoon
passes, and we skin them. Evening passes, and we eat
them. Never were foxes more welcome visitors, or treated
more like domestic animals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 27.</i>&mdash;We have been for some days in all the
flurry of preparation for our exploration trip: buffalo-hides,
leather, and tailoring utensils everywhere. Every particle
of fur comes in play for mits, and muffs, and wrappers.
Poor Flora is turned into a pair of socks, and looks almost
as pretty as when she was heading the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wind to-day made it intensely cold. In riding
but four miles to inspect a fox-trap, the movement froze
my cheeks twice. We avoid masks with great care, reserving
them for the severer weather; the jaw when protected
recovers very soon the sensibility which exposure
has subdued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>March 31.</i>&mdash;I was within an ace to-day of losing my
clogs, every one of them. When I reached the ice-foot,
they balked;&mdash;who would not?&mdash;the tide was low, the ice
rampant, and a jump of four feet necessary to reach the
crest. The howling of the wind and the whirl of the
snow-drift confused the poor creatures; but it was valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
training for them, and I strove to force them over. Of
course I was on foot, and they had a light load behind
them. &lsquo;Now, Stumpy! Now, Whitey!&rsquo; &lsquo;Good dogs!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tu-lee-&#275;&#275;-&#275;&#275;! Tuh!&rsquo; They went at it like good staunch
brutes, and the next minute the whole team was rolling in
a lump, some sixteen feet below me, in the chasm of the
ice-foot. The drift was such that at first I could not see
them. The roaring of the tide, and the subdued wail of
the dogs, made me fear for the worst. I had to walk
through the broken ice, which rose in toppling spires over
my head, for nearly fifty yards, before I found an opening
to the ice-face, by which I was able to climb down to them.
A few cuts of a sheath-knife released them, although the
caresses of the dear brutes had like to have been fatal to
me, for I had to straddle with one foot on the fast ice and
the other on loose piled rubbish. But I got a line attached
to the cross-pieces of the sledge-runners, flung it up on the
ice-foot, and then piloted my dogs out of their slough. In
about ten minutes we were sweating along at eight miles
an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything looked promising, and we were only waiting
for intelligence that our advance party had deposited its
provisions in safety to begin our transit of the bay. Except
a few sledge-lashings and some trifling accoutrements to
finish, all was ready.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad News</div>

<p>We were at work cheerfully, sewing away at the skins of
some moccasins by the blaze of our lamps, when, toward
midnight, we heard the noise of steps above, and the next
minute Sontag, Ohlsen, and Petersen, came down into the
cabin. Their manner startled me even more than their
unexpected appearance on board. They were swollen and
haggard, and hardly able to speak.</p>

<p>Their story was a fearful one. They had left their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
companions in the ice, risking their own lives to bring us
the news; Brooks, Baker, Wilson, and Pierre, were all
lying frozen and disabled. Where? They could not tell;
somewhere in among the hummocks to the north and east;
it was drifting heavily round them when they parted.
Irish Tom had stayed by to feed and care for the others;
but the chances were sorely against them. It was in vain
to question them further. They had evidently travelled a
great distance, for they were sinking with fatigue and
hunger, and could hardly be rallied enough to tell us the
direction in which they had come.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to move on the instant with an
unencumbered party; a rescue, to be effective even
hopeful, could not be too prompt. What pressed on my
mind most was where the sufferers were to be looked for
among the drifts. Ohlsen seemed to have his faculties
rather more at command than his associates, and I thought
that he might assist us as a guide; but he was sinking
with exhaustion, and if he went with us we must carry
him.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to be lost. While some were
still busy with the new-comers and getting ready a hasty
meal, others were rigging out the <i>Little Willie</i> with a
buffalo-cover, a small tent, and a package of pemmican;
and, as soon as we could hurry through our arrangements,
Ohlsen was strapped on in a fur bag, his legs wrapped in
dog skins and eider down, and we were off upon the ice.
Our party consisted of nine men and myself. We carried
only the clothes on our backs. The thermometer stood at
-46&deg;, seventy-eight below the freezing point.</p>

<p>A well known peculiar tower of ice, called by the men
the &ldquo;Pinnacly Berg,&rdquo; served as our first landmark other
icebergs of colossal size, which stretched in long beaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
lines across the bay, helped to guide us afterward; and it
was not until we had travelled for sixteen hours that we
began to lose our way.</p>

<p>We knew that our lost companions must be somewhere
in the area before us, within a radius of forty miles.
Ohlsen who had been for fifty hours without rest, fell
asleep; soon as we began to move, and awoke now with
unequivocal signs of mental disturbance. It became evident
that he had lost the bearing of the icebergs, which in
form and colour endlessly repeated themselves; and the
uniformity of the vast field of snow utterly forbade the
hope of local landmarks.</p>

<p>Pushing ahead of the party, and clambering over some
rugged ice-piles, I came to a long level floe, which I thought
might probably have attracted the eyes of weary men in
circumstances like our own. It was a light conjecture;
but it was enough to turn the scale, for there was no other
to balance it. I gave orders to abandon the sledge, and
disperse in search of footmarks. We raised our tent, placed
our pemmican in <i>cache</i>, except a small allowance for each
man to carry on his person; and poor Ohlsen, now just
able to keep his legs, was liberated from his bag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affect of the Cold</div>

<p>It was indispensable that we should move on, looking
out for traces as we went. Yet when the men were
ordered to spread themselves, so as to multiply the chances,
though they all obeyed heartily, some painful impress of
solitary danger, or perhaps it may have been the varying
configuration of the ice-field, kept them closing up continually
into a single group. The strange manner in which
some of us were affected I now attribute as much to
shattered nerves as to the direct influence of the cold.
Men like M&rsquo;Gary and Bonsall, who had stood out our
severest marches, were seized with trembling fits and short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
breath; and, in spite of all my efforts to keep up an
example of sound bearing, I fainted twice on the snow.</p>

<p>We had been nearly eighteen hours out, without water or
food, when a new hope cheered us. I think it was Hans,
our Esquimaux hunter, who thought he saw a broad sledge-track.
The drift had nearly effaced it, and we were some
of us doubtful at first whether it was not one of those
accidental rifts which the gales make in the surface-snow.
But, as we traced it on to the deep snow among the hummocks,
we were led to footsteps; and, following these with
religious care, we at last came in sight of a small American
flag fluttering from a hummock, and lower down a little
masonic banner hanging from a tent-pole hardly above
the drift. It was the camp of our disabled comrades;
we reached it after an unbroken march of twenty-one
hours.</p>

<p>The little tent was nearly covered. I was not among
the first to come up; but, when I reached the tent-curtain,
the men were standing in silent file on each side of it.
With more kindness and delicacy of feeling than is often
supposed to belong to sailors, but which is almost characteristic,
they intimated their wish that I should go in alone.
As I crawled in, and, coming upon the darkness, heard
before me the burst of welcome gladness that came from
the four poor fellows stretched on their backs, and then
for the first time the cheer outside, my weakness and my
gratitude together almost overcame me. &ldquo;They had expected
me: they were sure I would come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were now fifteen souls; the thermometer 75&deg; below
the freezing point; and our sole accommodation a tent
barely able to contain eight persons: more than half our
party were obliged to keep from freezing by walking outside
while the others slept. We could not halt long.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
Each of us took a turn of two hours&rsquo; sleep, and we prepared
for our homeward march.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Retreat</div>

<p>We took with us nothing but the tent, furs to protect
the rescued party, and food for a journey of fifty hours.
Everything else was abandoned. Two large buffalo-bags,
each made of four skins, were doubled up, so as to form a
sort of sack, lined on each side by fur, closed at the bottom,
but opened at the top. This was laid on the sledge; the
tent, smoothly folded, serving as a floor. The sick, with
their limbs sewed up carefully in reindeer-skins, were
placed upon the bed of buffalo-robes, in a half-reclining
posture; other skins and blanket-bags were thrown above
them; and the whole litter was lashed together so as to
allow but a single opening opposite the mouth for breathing.</p>

<p>This necessary work cost us a great deal of time and
effort; but it was essential to the lives of the sufferers. It
took us no less than four hours to strip and refresh them,
and then to embale them in the manner I have described.
Few of us escaped without frost-bitten fingers.</p>

<p>It was completed at last, however; all hands stood
round, and after repeating a short prayer, we set out on
our retreat. It was fortunate indeed that we were not
inexperienced in sledging over the ice. A great part of
our track lay among a succession of hummocks, some of
them extending in long lines, fifteen or twenty feet high,
and so uniformly steep that we had to turn them by a considerable
deviation from our direct course; others that we
forced our way through, far above our heads in height,
lying in parallel ridges, with the space between too narrow
for the sledge to be lowered into it safely, and yet not
enough for the runners to cross without the aid of
ropes to stay them. These spaces, too, were generally
choked with light snow, hiding the openings between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
ice-fragments. They were fearful traps to disengage a
limb from, for every man knew that a fracture, or a sprain
even, would cost him his life. Besides all this, the sledge
was top-heavy with its load: the maimed men could not
bear to be lashed down tight enough to secure them against
falling off. Notwithstanding our caution in rejecting every
superfluous burden, the weight, including bags and tent,
was eleven hundred pounds.</p>

<p>And yet our march for the first six hours was very cheering.
We made, by vigorous pulls and lifts, nearly a mile
an hour, and reached the new floes before we were absolutely
weary. Our sledge sustained the trial admirably.
Ohlsen, restored by hope, walked steadily at the leading belt
of the sledge lines; and I began to feel certain of reaching
our half-way station of the day before, where we had left
our tent. But we were still nine miles from it, when,
almost without premonition, we all became aware of an
alarming failure of our energies.</p>

<p>Bonsall and Morton, two of our stoutest men, came to me,
begging permission to sleep. &ldquo;They were not cold, the
wind did not enter them now,&mdash;a little sleep was all they
wanted.&rdquo; Presently Hans was found nearly stiff under a
drift; and Thomas, bolt upright, had his eyes closed, and
could hardly articulate. At last John Blake threw himself
on the snow, and refused to rise. They did not complain
of feeling cold; but it was in vain that I wrestled, boxed,
ran, argued, jeered, or reprimanded: an immediate halt
could not be avoided.</p>

<p>We pitched our tent with much difficulty. Our hands
were too powerless to strike a fire; we were obliged to do
without water or food. Even the spirits (whisky) had
frozen at the men&rsquo;s feet, under all the coverings. We put
Bonsall, Ohlsen, Thomas, and Hans, with the other sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
men, well inside the tent, and crowded in as many others
as we could. Then, leaving the party in charge of Mr
M&rsquo;Gary, with orders to come on after four hours&rsquo; rest, I
pushed ahead with William Godfrey, who volunteered to
be my companion. My aim was to reach the half-way
tent, and thaw some ice and pemmican before the others
arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bear Frolic</div>

<p>The floe was of level ice, and the walking excellent. I
cannot tell how long it took us to make the nine miles, for
we were in a strange sort of stupor, and had little apprehension
of time. It was probably about four hours. We
kept ourselves awake by imposing on each other a continued
articulation of words; they must have been incoherent
enough. I recall these hours as among the most
wretched I have ever gone through: we were neither of us
in our right senses, and retained a very confused recollection
of what preceded our arrival at the tent. We both of
us, however, remember a bear, who walked leisurely before
us, and tore up as he went a jumper that Mr M&rsquo;Gary had
improvidently thrown off the day before. He tore it into
shreds and rolled it into a ball, but never offered to interfere
with our progress. I remember this, and with it a
confused sentiment that our tent and buffalo-robes might
probably share the same fate. Godfrey, with whom the
memory of this day&rsquo;s work may atone for many faults of a
later time, had a better eye than myself; and, looking
some miles ahead, he could see that our tent was undergoing
the same unceremonious treatment. I thought I
saw it too, but we were so drunken with cold that we
strode on steadily, and, for aught I know, without quickening
our pace.</p>

<p>Probably our approach saved the contents of the tent;
for when we reached it the tent was uninjured, though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
bear had overturned it, tossing the buffalo-robes and pemmican
into the snow; we missed only a couple of blanket-bags.
What we recollect, however,&mdash;and perhaps all we
recollect,&mdash;is, that we had great difficulty in raising it. We
crawled into our reindeer sleeping-bags without speaking,
and for the next three hours slept on in a dreamy but
intense slumber. When I awoke, my long beard was a
mass of ice, frozen fast to the buffalo-skin; Godfrey had
to cut me out with his jack-knife. Four days after our
escape, I found my woollen comfortable with a goodly share
of my beard still adhering to it.</p>

<p>We were able to melt water and get some soup cooked
before the rest of our party arrived: it took them but five
hours to walk the nine miles. They were doing well, and,
considering the circumstances, in wonderful spirits. The
day was almost providentially windless, with a clear sun.
All enjoyed the refreshment we had got ready: the crippled
were repacked in their robes; and we sped briskly toward
the hummock-ridges which lay between us and the Pinnacly
Berg.</p>

<p>It required desperate efforts to work our way over it&mdash;literally
desperate, for our strength failed us anew, and we
began to lose our self-control. We could not abstain any
longer from eating snow; our mouths swelled, and some of
us became speechless.</p>

<p>Our halts multiplied, and we fell half-sleeping on the
snow. I could not prevent it. Strange to say, it refreshed
us. I ventured upon the experiment myself, making Riley
wake me at the end of three minutes; and I felt so much
benefited by it that I timed the men in the same way.
They sat on the runners of the sledge, fell asleep instantly,
and were forced to wakefulness when their three minutes
were out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span></p>

<p>By eight in the evening we emerged from the floes. The
Bight of Pinnacly Berg revived us. Brandy, an invaluable
resource in emergency, had already been served out in
table-spoonful doses. We now took a longer rest, and a
last but stouter dram, and reached the brig at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, we
believe without a halt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental Failure</div>

<p>I say <i>we believe</i>; and here perhaps is the most decided
proof of our sufferings; we were quite delirious, and had
ceased to entertain a sane apprehension of the circumstances
about us. We moved on like men in a dream. Our footmarks
seen afterward showed that we had steered a
straight line for the brig. It must have been by a sort of
instinct, for it left no impress on the memory. Bonsall
was sent staggering ahead, and reached the brig, God
knows how, for he had fallen repeatedly at the track-lines;
but he delivered with punctilious accuracy the messages I
had sent by him to Dr Hayes. I thought myself the
soundest of all, for I went through all the formula of
sanity, and can recall the muttering delirium of my comrades
when we got back into the cabin of our brig. Yet I
have been told since of some speeches and some orders too
of mine, which I should have remembered for their absurdity,
if my mind had retained its balance.</p>

<p>Petersen and Whipple came out to meet us about two
miles from the brig. They brought my dog-team, with
the restoratives I had sent for by Bonsall. I do not
remember their coming. Dr Hayes entered with judicious
energy upon the treatment our condition called for, administering
morphine freely, after the usual frictions. He
reported none of our brain-symptoms as serious, referring
them properly to the class of those indications of exhausted
power which yield to generous diet and rest. Mr Ohlsen
suffered some time from strabismus and blindness; two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
others underwent amputation of parts of the foot without
unpleasant consequences, and two died in spite of all our
efforts. This rescue-party had been out for seventy-two
hours. We had halted in all eight hours, half of our number
sleeping at a time. We travelled between eighty and
ninety miles, most of the way dragging a heavy sledge.
The mean temperature of the whole time, including the
warmest hours of three days, was at -41&deg;&middot;2. We had no
water except at our halts, and were at no time able to
intermit vigorous exercise without freezing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 4.</i>&mdash;Four days have passed, and I am again at
my record of failures, sound, but aching still in every joint.
The rescued men are not out of danger, but their gratitude
is very touching. Pray God that they may live!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE FIRST STRANGE FACES&mdash;THE ESQUIMAUX.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> week that followed has left me nothing to remember
but anxieties and sorrow. Nearly all our party, as well
the rescuers as the rescued, were tossing in their sick-bunks,
some frozen, others undergoing amputations, several
with dreadful premonitions of tetanus. I was myself
among the first to be about; the necessities of the others
claimed it of me.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 7th I was awakened by a
sound from Baker&rsquo;s throat, one of those the most frightful
and ominous that ever startle a physician&rsquo;s ear. The lock-jaw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
had seized him&mdash;that dark visitant whose foreshadowings
were on so many of us. His symptoms marched
rapidly to their result; he died the next day. On the 9th
we placed him in his coffin, and, forming a rude, but heart-full
procession, bore him over the broken ice and up the
steep side of the ice-foot to Butler Island; then, passing
along the snow-level to Fern Rock, and climbing the slope
of the Observatory, we deposited his corpse upon the
pedestals which had served to support our instruments.
We read the service for the burial of the dead, sprinkling
over him snow for dust, and repeated the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer;
and then icing up again the opening in the walls we had
made to admit the coffin, left him in his narrow house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Esquimaux</div>

<p>We were watching in the morning at Baker&rsquo;s death-bed,
when one of our deck-watch, who had been cutting ice for
the melter, came hurrying down into the cabin with the
report, &ldquo;People holloaing ashore!&rdquo; I went up, followed
by as many as could mount the gangway; and there they
were, on all sides of our rocky harbour, dotting the snow-shores
and emerging from the blackness of the cliffs,&mdash;wild
and uncouth, but evidently human beings.</p>

<p>As we gathered on the deck, they rose upon the more
elevated fragments of the land-ice, and distributing themselves
around almost in a half-circle. They were vociferating
as if to attract our attention, or perhaps only to give
vent to their surprise; but I could make nothing out of
their cries, except &ldquo;Hoah, ha, ha!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ka, k&#259;&#257;h! ka,
k&#259;&#257;h!&rdquo; repeated over and over again.</p>

<p>There was light enough for me to see that they brandished
no weapons, and were only tossing their heads and arms
about in violent gesticulations. A more unexcited inspection
showed us, too, that their numbers were not as great
nor their size as large as some of us had been disposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
fancy at first. In a word, I was satisfied that they were
natives of the country; and, calling Petersen from his bunk
to be my interpreter, I proceeded unarmed, and waving
my open hands, toward a stout figure who made himself
conspicuous, and seemed to have a greater number near
him than the rest. He evidently understood the movement,
for he at once, like a brave fellow, leaped down upon
the floe and advanced to meet me fully half-way.</p>

<p>He was nearly a head taller than myself, extremely
powerful and well-built, with swarthy complexion and
piercing black eyes. His dress was a hooded <i>capôte</i> or
jumper of mixed white and blue fox-pelts, arranged with
something of fancy, and booted trousers of white bear-skin,
which at the end of the foot were made to terminate with
the claws of the animal.</p>

<p>I soon came to an understanding with this gallant diplomatist.
Almost as soon as we commenced our parley, his
companions, probably receiving signals from him, flocked
in and surrounded us; but we had no difficulty in making
them know positively that they must remain where they
were, while Metek went with me on board the ship. This
gave me the advantage of negotiating with an important
hostage.</p>

<p>Although this was the first time he had ever seen a
white man, he went with me fearlessly; his companions
staying behind on the ice. Hickey took them out what
he esteemed our greatest delicacies,&mdash;slices of good wheat
bread and corned pork, with exorbitant lumps of white
sugar; but they refused to touch them. They had evidently
no apprehension of open violence from us. I found
afterward that several among them were singly a match for
the white bear and the walrus, and that they thought us a
very pale-faced crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Outfit of the Esquimaux</div>

<p>Being satisfied with my interview in the cabin, I sent
out word that the rest might be admitted to the ship; and,
although they, of course, could not know how their chief
had been dealt with, some nine or ten of them followed
with boisterous readiness upon the bidding. Others in the
meantime, as if disposed to give us their company for the
full time of a visit, brought up from behind the land-ice
as many as fifty-six fine dogs, with their sledges, and
secured them within two hundred feet of the brig, driving
their lances into the ice, and picketing the dogs to them by
the seal-skin traces. The animals understood the operation
perfectly, and lay down as soon as it commenced.
The sledges were made up of small fragments of porous
bone, admirably knit together by thongs of hide; the
runners, which glistened like burnished steel, were of
highly-polished ivory, obtained from the tusks of the
walrus.</p>

<p>The only arms they carried were knives, concealed in
their boots; but their lances, which were lashed to the
sledges, were quite a formidable weapon. The staff was
of the horn of the narwhal, or else of the thigh-bones of
the bear, two lashed together, or sometimes the mirabilis
of the walrus, three or four of them united. This last was
a favourite material also for the cross-bars of their sledges.
They had no wood. A single rusty hoop from a current-drifted
cask might have furnished all the knives of the
party; but the flame-shaped tips of their lances were of
unmistakable steel, and were riveted to the tapering bony
point with no mean skill. I learned afterward that the
metal was obtained in traffic from the more southern tribes.</p>

<p>They were clad much as I have described Metek, in
jumpers, boots, and white bear-skin breeches, with their
feet decorated like his, <i>en griffe</i>. A strip of knotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
leather worn round the neck, very greasy and dirty-looking,
which no one could be persuaded to part with for an
instant, was mistaken at first for an ornament by the crew:
it was not until mutual hardships had made us better
acquainted that we learned its mysterious uses.</p>

<p>When they were first allowed to come on board, they
were very rude and difficult to manage. They spoke three
or four at a time, to each other and to us, laughing heartily
at our ignorance in not understanding them, and then talking
away as before. They were incessantly in motion,
going everywhere, trying doors, and squeezing themselves
through dark passages, round casks and boxes, and out
into the light again, anxious to touch and handle everything
they saw, and asking for, or else endeavouring to
steal, everything they touched. It was the more difficult
to restrain them, as I did not wish them to suppose that
we were at all intimidated. But there were some signs
of our disabled condition which it was important they
should not see; it was especially necessary to keep them
out of the forecastle, where the dead body of poor Baker
was lying; and, as it was in vain to reason or persuade,
we had at last to employ the &ldquo;gentle laying-on of hands,&rdquo;
which, I believe, the laws of all countries tolerate, to keep
them in order.</p>

<p>Our whole force was mustered and kept constantly on
the alert; but though there may have been something of
discourtesy in the occasional shoulderings and bustlings
that enforced the police of the ship, things went on good-humouredly.
Our guests continued running in and out
and about the vessel, bringing in provisions, and carrying
them out again to their dogs on the ice,&mdash;in fact, stealing
all the time until the afternoon, when, like tired children,
they threw themselves down to sleep. I ordered them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
be made comfortable in the hold; and Morton spread a
large buffalo-robe for them, not far from a coal-fire in the
galley-stove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eating Habits</div>

<p>They were lost in barbarous amaze at the new fuel,&mdash;too
hard for blubber, too soft for firestone,&mdash;but they were
content to believe it might cook as well as seals&rsquo; fat. They
borrowed from us an iron pot and some melted water, and
parboiled a couple of pieces of walrus-meat; but the real
<i>pièce de resistance</i>, some five pounds a head, they preferred
to eat raw. Yet there was something of the <i>gourmet</i> in
their mode of assorting their mouthfuls of beef and blubber
Slices of each, or rather strips, passed between the lips,
either together or in strict alternation, and with a regularity
of sequence that kept the molars well to their work.</p>

<p>They did not eat all at once, but each man when and as
often as the impulse prompted. Each slept after eating,
his raw meat lying beside him on the buffalo-skin; and as
he woke, the first act was to eat, and the next to sleep
again. They did not lie down, but slumbered away in a
sitting posture, with the head declined upon the breast,
some of them snoring famously.</p>

<p>In the morning they were anxious to go; but I had
given orders to detain them for a parting interview with
myself. It resulted in a treaty, brief in its terms, that it
might be certainly remembered, and mutually beneficial,
that it might possibly be kept. I tried to make them
understand what a powerful Prospero they had had for a
host, and how beneficent he would prove himself so long
as they did his bidding. And, as an earnest of my favour,
I bought all the walrus-meat they had to spare, and four
of their dogs enriching them in return with needles and
beads, and a treasure of old cask-staves.</p>

<p>In the fulness of their gratitude, they pledged themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
emphatically to return in a few days with more meat,
and to allow me to use their dogs and sledges for my
excursions to the north. I then gave them leave to go.
They yoked in their dogs in less than two minutes, got on
their sledges, cracked their two-fathom-and-a-half-long seal-skin
whips, and were off down the ice to the south-west at
a rate of seven knots an hour.</p>

<p>They did not return. I had read enough of treaty-makings
not to expect them too confidently. But the next
day came a party of five, on foot&mdash;two old men, one of
middle age, and a couple of gawky boys. We had missed
a number of articles soon after the first party left us, an
axe, a saw, and some knives. We found afterward that
our storehouse at Butler Island had been entered; we were
too short-handed to guard it by a special watch. Besides all
this, reconnoitring stealthily beyond Sylvia Head, we discovered
a train of sledges drawn up behind the hummocks.</p>

<p>There was cause for apprehension in all this; but I felt
that I could not afford to break with the rogues. They
had it in their power to molest us seriously in our sledge-travel;
they could make our hunts around the harbour
dangerous; and my best chance of obtaining an abundant
supply of fresh meat, our great desideratum, was by their
agency. I treated the new party with marked kindness,
and gave them many presents; but took care to make
them aware that, until all the missing articles were restored,
no member of the tribe would be admitted again
as a guest on board the brig. They went off with many
pantomimic protestations of innocence; but M&rsquo;Gary, nevertheless,
caught the incorrigible scamps stealing a coal-barrel
as they passed Butler Island, and expedited their
journey homeward by firing among them a charge of small
shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span></p>

<p>Still, one peculiar worthy&mdash;we thought it must have
been the venerable of the party, whom I knew afterwards
as a staunch friend, old Shang-hu&mdash;managed to work
round in a westerly direction, and to cut to pieces my
India-rubber boat, which had been left on the floe since
Mr Brook&rsquo;s disaster, and to carry off every particle of the
wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;Myouk&rdquo;</div>

<p>A few days after this, an agile, elfin youth drove up to
our floe in open day. He was sprightly and good-looking,
and had quite a neat turn-out of sledge and dogs. He told
his name with frankness,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Myouk</i>, I am,&rdquo;&mdash;and where he
lived. We asked him about the boat; but he denied all
knowledge of it, and refused either to confess or repent.
He was surprised when I ordered him to be confined to the
hold. At first he refused to eat, and sat down in the
deepest grief; but after a while he began to sing, and then
to talk and cry, and then to sing again; and he kept crying,
singing, and talking by turns, till a late hour of the
night. When I turned in, he was still noisily disconsolate.</p>

<p>There was a simplicity and <i>bonhommie</i> about this boy
that interested me much; and I confess that when I made
my appearance next morning&mdash;I could hardly conceal it
from the gentleman on duty, whom I affected to censure&mdash;I
was glad my bird had flown. Some time during the
morning-watch he had succeeded in throwing off the hatch
and escaping. We suspected that he had confederates
ashore, for his dogs had escaped with as much address as
himself. I was convinced, however, that I had the truth
from him, where he lived, and how many lived with him&mdash;my
cross-examination on these points having been very
complete and satisfactory.</p>

<p>It was a sad business for some time after these Esquimaux
left us, to go on making and registering our observations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
at Fern Rock. Baker&rsquo;s corpse still lay in the
vestibule, and it was not long before another was placed
by the side of it. We had to pass the bodies as often as
we went in or out; but the men, grown feeble and nervous,
disliked going near them in the night-time. When the
summer thaw came, and we could gather stones enough,
we built up a grave on a depression of the rocks, and
raised a substantial cairn above it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 19.</i>&mdash;I have been out on the floe again, breaking
in my dogs. My reinforcement from the Esquimaux
makes a noble team for me. For the last five days I have
been striving with them, just as often and as long as my
strength allowed me; and to-day I have my victory. The
Society for Preventing Cruelty to Animals would have put
me in custody if they had been near enough; but, thanks
to a merciless whip freely administered, I have been dashing
along twelve miles in the last hour, and am back
again; harness, sledge, and bones all unbroken. I am
ready for another journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 22.</i>&mdash;Schubert has increasing symptoms of erysipelas
around his amputated stump; and every one on
board is depressed and silent except himself. He is singing
in his bunk, as joyously as ever. Poor fellow! I am
alarmed about him: it is a hard duty which compels me to
take the field, while my presence might cheer his last
moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption3">A NEW EXPLORATION&mdash;RETURN OF SPRING.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> month of April was about to close, and the short
season available for Arctic search was upon us. The condition
of things on board the brig was not such as I could
have wished for; but there was nothing to exact my presence,
and it seemed to me clear that the time had come
for pressing on the work of the expedition. The arrangements
for our renewed exploration had not been intermitted,
and were soon complete. I leave to my journal its own
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 25.</i>&mdash;A journey on the carpet, and the crew
busy with the little details of their outfit: the officers the
same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">April 26.</span>&mdash;These Esquimaux must be watched carefully;
at the same time they are to be dealt with kindly,
though with a strict enforcement of our police regulations,
and some caution as to the freedom with which they may
come on board. No punishments must be permitted, either
of them or in their presence, and no resort to fire-arms
unless to repel a serious attack. I have given orders
however, that if the contingency does occur, there shall be
no firing over head. The <i>prestige</i> of the gun with a savage
is in his notion of its infallibility. You may spare blood-shed
by killing a dog, or even wounding him; but in no
event should you throw away your ball it is neither
politic nor humane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our stowage precautions are all arranged, to meet the
chance of the ice breaking up while I am away; and a boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
is placed ashore with stores, as the brig may be forced
from her moorings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst thought I have now in setting out is, that
of the entire crew I can leave but two behind in able condition,
and the doctor and Bonsall are the only two officers
who can help Ohlsen. This is our force, four able-bodied,
and six disabled, to keep the brig; the commander and
seven men, scarcely better upon the average, out upon the
ice. Eighteen souls, thank God! certainly not eighteen
bodies!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going this time to follow the ice-belt to the
Great Glacier of Humboldt, and there load up with pemmican
from our <i>cache</i> of last October. From this point I
expect to stretch along the face of the glacier inclining to
the west of north, and make an attempt to cross the ice to
the American side. Once on smooth ice, near this shore,
I may pass to the west, and enter the large indentation
whose existence I can infer with nearly positive certainty.
In this I may find an outlet, and determine the state of
things beyond the ice-clogged area of this bay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take with me pemmican, bread, and tea, a canvas
tent, five feet by six, and two sleeping bags of reindeer-skin.
The sledge has been built on board by Mr Ohlsen.
It is very light, of hickory, and but nine feet long. Our
kitchen is a soup-kettle for melting snow and making tea,
arranged so as to boil with either lard or spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Gary has taken the <i>Faith</i>. He carries few stores,
intending to replenish at the <i>cache</i> of Bonsall Point, and
to lay in pemmican at M&rsquo;Gary Island. Most of his cargo
consists of bread, which we find it hard to dispense with
in eating cooked food. It has a good effect in absorbing
the fat of the pemmican, which is apt to disagree with the
stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A New Start</div>

<p>Godfrey and myself followed on the 27th, as I had
intended. The journey was an arduous one to be undertaken,
even under the most favouring circumstances, and
by unbroken men. It was to be the crowning expedition
of the campaign, to attain the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the Greenland
shore, measure the waste that lay between it and the
unknown West, and seek round the furthest circle of the
ice for an outlet to the mysterious channels beyond. The
scheme could not be carried out in its details; yet it was
prosecuted far enough to indicate what must be our future
fields of labour, and to determine many points of geographical
interest. Our observations were in general confirmatory
of those which had been made by Mr Bonsall;
and they accorded so well with our subsequent surveys
as to trace for us the outline of the coast with great
certainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now the 20th of May, and for the first time I am
able, propped up by pillows and surrounded by sick messmates,
to note the fact that we have failed again to force
the passage to the north.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Godfrey and myself overtook the advance party under
M&rsquo;Gary two days after leaving the brig. Our dogs were
in fair travelling condition, and, except snow-blindness,
there seemed to be no drawback to our efficiency. In
crossing Marshall Bay we found the snow so accumulated
in drifts that, with all our efforts to pick out a track, we
became involved; we could not force our sledges through.
We were forced to unload, and carry forward the cargo on
our backs, beating a path for the dogs to follow in. In
this way we plodded on to the opposite headland, Cape
William Wood, where the waters of Mary Minturn River,
which had delayed the freezing of the ice, gave us a long
reach of level travel. We then made a better rate; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
our days&rsquo; marches were such as to carry us by the 4th of
May nearly to the glacier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This progress, however, was dearly earned. As early
as the 3d of May the winter&rsquo;s scurvy re-appeared painfully
among our party. As we struggled through the snow
along the Greenland coast we sank up to our middle; and
the dogs, floundering about, were so buried as to preclude
any attempts at hauling. Here three of the party were
taken with snow-blindness, and George Stephenson had to
be condemned as unfit for travel altogether, on account of
chest-symptoms accompanying his scorbutic troubles. On
the 4th Thomas Hickey also gave in, although not quite
disabled for labour at the track-lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we would still have got on; but, to crown all,
we found that the bears had effected an entrance into our
pemmican casks, and destroyed our chances of reinforcing
our provisions at the several <i>caches</i>. This great calamity
was certainly inevitable; for it is simple justice to the
officers under whose charge the provision depôts were constructed,
to say that no means in their power could have
prevented the result. The pemmican was covered with
blocks of stone, which it had required the labour of three
men to adjust; but the extraordinary strength of the bear
had enabled him to force aside the heaviest rocks, and his
pawing had broken the iron casks which held our pemmican
literally into chips. Our alcohol cask, which it had cost
me a separate and special journey in the late fall to deposit,
was so completely destroyed that we could not find a stave
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Misfortunes</div>

<p>&ldquo;Off Cape James Kent, about eight miles from &lsquo;Sunny
Gorge,&rsquo; while taking an observation for latitude, I was
myself seized with a sudden pain, and fainted. My limbs
became rigid, and certain obscure tetanoid symptoms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
our late winter&rsquo;s enemy disclosed themselves. In this
condition I was unable to make more than nine miles
a day. I was strapped upon the sledge, and the march
continued as usual; but my powers diminished so rapidly
that I could not resist even the otherwise comfortable
temperament of 5&deg; below zero. My left foot becoming
frozen, caused a vexatious delay; and the same night it
became evident that the immovability of my limbs was
due to dropsical effusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 5th, becoming delirious, and fainting every
time that I was taken from the tent to the sledge, I succumbed
entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scurvy had already broken out among the men,
with symptoms like my own; and Morton, our strongest
man, was beginning to give way. It is the reverse of
comfort to me that they shared my weakness. All that I
should remember with pleasurable feeling is, that to five
brave men,&mdash;Morton, Riley, Hickey, Stephenson, and Hans,
themselves scarcely able to travel,&mdash;I owe my preservation.
They carried me back by forced marches, and I was taken
into the brig on the 14th. Since then, fluctuating between
life and death, I have by the blessing of God reached the
present date, and see feebly in prospect my recovery. Dr
Hayes regards my attack as one of scurvy, complicated by
typhoid fever. George Stephenson is similarly affected.
Our worst symptoms are dropsical effusion and night-sweats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 22.</i>&mdash;Let me, if I can, make up my record for
the time I have been away, or on my back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Schubert is gone. Our gallant, merry-hearted
companion left us some ten days ago, for, I trust, a more
genial world. It is sad, in this dreary little homestead of
ours, to miss his contented face and the joyous troll of his
ballads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The health of the rest has, if anything, improved.
Their complexions show the influence of sunlight, and I
think several have a firmer and more elastic step. Stephenson
and Thomas are the only two beside myself who are
likely to suffer permanently from the effects of our breakdown.
Bad scurvy both: symptoms still serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left Hans as hunter. I gave him a regular exemption
from all other labour, and a promised present to his lady-love
on reaching Fiskernaes. He signalised his promotion
by shooting two deer, <i>Tukkuk</i>, the first yet shot. We
have now on hand one hundred and forty-five pounds of
venison, a very gift of grace to our diseased crew. But,
indeed, we are not likely to want for wholesome food, now
that the night is gone, which made our need of it so pressing.
On the first of May those charming little migrants,
the snow-birds, <i>ultima cælicolum</i>, which only left us on
the 4th of November, returned to our ice-crusted rocks,
whence they seem to &lsquo;fill the sea and air with their sweet
jargoning.&rsquo; Seal literally abound, too. I have learned to
prefer this flesh to the reindeer&rsquo;s, at least that of the
female seal, which has not the fetor of her mate&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the 12th, the sides of the <i>Advance</i> were free from
snow, and her rigging clean and dry. The floe is rapidly
undergoing its wonderful processes of decay, and the level
ice measures but six feet in thickness. To-day they report
a burgomaster-gull seen, one of the earliest but surest
indications of returning open water. It is not strange, ice-leaguered
exiles as we are, that we observe and exult in
these things. They are the pledges of renewed life, the
olive-branch of this dreary waste: we feel the spring in all
our pulses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing I did after my return was to send
M&rsquo;Gary to the Life-boat Cove, to see that our boat and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
buried provisions were secure. He made the journey by
dog-sledge in four days, and has returned reporting that all
is safe&mdash;an important help for us, should this heavy ice of
our more northern prison refuse to release us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the pleasantest feature of his journey was the disclosure
of open water, extending up in a sort of tongue,
with a trend of north by east to within two miles of Refuge
Harbour, and there widening as it expanded to the south
and west.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Difficulties</div>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as I had recovered enough to be aware of my
failure, I began to devise means for remedying it. But I
found the resources of the party shattered. Pierre had
died but a week before, and his death exerted an unfavourable
influence. There were only three men able to do duty.
Of the officers, Wilson, Brooks, Sontag, and Petersen, were
knocked up. There was no one except Sontag, Hayes, or
myself who was qualified to conduct a survey; and, of us
three, Dr Hayes was the only one on his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The quarter to which our remaining observations were
to be directed lay to the north and east of the Cape Sabine
of Captain Inglefield. The interruption our progress along
the coast of Greenland had met from the Great Glacier,
and destruction of our provision-caches by the bears, left
a blank for us of the entire northern coast-line. It was
necessary to ascertain whether the farthermost expansion
of Smith&rsquo;s Strait did not find an outlet in still more remote
channels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I determined to trust almost entirely to the dogs for
our travel in the future, and to send our parties of exploration,
one after the other, as rapidly as the strength and
refreshing of our team would permit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr Hayes was selected for that purpose; and I satisfied
myself that, with a little assistance from my comrades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
I could be carried round to the cots of the sick, and so
avail myself of his services in the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a perfectly fresh man, not having yet undertaken
a journey. I gave him a team and my best driver,
William Godfrey. He is to cross Smith&rsquo;s Straits above
the inlet, and make as near as may be a straight course for
Cape Sabine. My opinion is, that by keeping well south
he will find the ice less clogged and easier sledging. Our
experience proves, I think, that the transit of this broken
area must be most impeded as we approach the glacier.
The immense discharge of icebergs cannot fail to break it
up seriously for travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave him the small sledge which was built by Ohlsen.
The snow was sufficiently thawed to make it almost unnecessary
to use fire as a means of obtaining water; they
could therefore dispense with tallow or alcohol, and were
able to carry pemmican in larger quantities. Their sleeping-bags
were a very neat article of a light reindeer-skin. The
dogs were in excellent condition too&mdash;no longer foot-sore,
but well rested and completely broken, including the four
from the Esquimaux, animals of great power and size.
Two of these, the stylish leaders of the team, a span of
thoroughly wolfish iron-greys, have the most powerful and
wild-beast-like bound that I have seen in animals of their
kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made up the orders of the party on the 19th, the
first day that I was able to mature a plan; and with commendable
zeal they left the brig on the 20th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 23.</i>&mdash;They have had superb weather, thank
heaven!&mdash;a profusion of the most genial sunshine, bringing
out the seals in crowds to bask around their breathing-holes.
Winter has gone!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 26.</i>&mdash;I get little done; but I have too much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
attend to in my weak state to journalise. Thermometer
above freezing-point, without the sun to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 27.</i>&mdash;Everything showing that the summer-changes
have commenced. The ice is rapidly losing its integrity,
and a melting snow has fallen for the last two days,&mdash;one
of those comforting home-snows that we have not seen for
so long.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pierre Schubert</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 28.</i>&mdash;Our day of rest and devotion. It was a fortnight
ago last Friday since our poor friend Pierre died.
For nearly two months he had been struggling against the
enemy with a resolute will and mirthful spirit, that seemed
sure of victory; but he sunk in spite of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last offices were rendered to him with the same
careful ceremonial that we observed at Baker&rsquo;s funeral.
There were fewer to walk in the procession; but the body
was encased in a decent pine coffin, and carried to Observatory
Island, where it was placed side by side with that
of his messmate. Neither could yet be buried; but it is
hardly necessary to say that the frost has embalmed their
remains. Dr Hayes read the chapter from Job which has
consigned so many to their last resting-place, and a little
snow was sprinkled upon the face of the coffin. Pierre
was a volunteer not only of our general expedition, but of
the party with which he met his death-blow. He was a
gallant man, a universal favourite on board, always singing
some Béranger ballad or other, and so elastic in his merriment,
that even in his last sickness he cheered all that
were about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 30.</i>&mdash;We are gleaning fresh water from the rocks,
and the icebergs begin to show commencing streamlets.
The great floe is no longer a Sahara, if still a desert. The
floes are wet, and their snow dissolve readily under the
warmth of the foot, and the old floe begins to shed fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
water into its hollows. Puddles of salt water collect
around the ice-foot. It is now hardly recognisable,&mdash;rounded,
sunken, broken up with water-pools overflowing
its base. Its diminished crusts are so percolated by the
saline tides, that neither tables nor broken fragments unite
any longer by freezing. It is lessening so rapidly that we
do not fear it any longer as an enemy to the brig. The
berg indeed vanished long before the sun-thermometers
indicated a noon temperature above 32&deg;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seal grow still more numerous on the level floes, lying
cautiously in the sun beside their breathing-holes. By
means of the Esquimaux stratagem of a white screen
pushed forward on a sledge until the concealed hunter
comes within range, Hans has shot four of them. We have
more fresh meat than we can eat. For the past three weeks
we have been living on ptarmigan, rabbits, two reindeer,
and seal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are fast curing our scurvy. With all these resources,
coming to our relief so suddenly too, how can my
thoughts turn despairingly to poor Franklin and his crew?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they have survived? No man can answer with
certainty; but no man without presumption can answer in
the negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, four months ago,&mdash;surrounded by darkness and
bowed down by disease,&mdash;I had been asked the question, I
would have turned toward the black hills and the frozen sea,
and responded in sympathy with them, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; But with the
return of light a savage people come down upon us, destitute
of any but the rudest appliances of the chase, who were
fattening on the most wholesome diet of the region, only
forty miles from our anchorage, while I was denouncing
its scarcity.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ADVENT OF THE SECOND YEAR.</p>


<p class="p0">&ldquo;<i>Map 30, 1854.</i>&mdash;It is a year ago to-day since we left
New York. I am not as sanguine as I was then: time
and experience have chastened me. There is everything
about me to check enthusiasm and moderate hope. I am
here in forced inaction, a broken-down man, oppressed by
cares, with many dangers before me, and still under the
shadow of a hard wearing winter, which has crushed
two of my best associates. Here, on the spot, after two
unavailing expeditions of search, I hold my opinions unchanged;
and I record them as a matter of duty upon a
manuscript which may speak the truth when I can do so
no longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dogs</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 1.</i>&mdash;At ten o&rsquo;clock this morning the wail of
the dogs outside announced the return of Dr Hayes and
William Godfrey. Both of them were completely snow-blind,
and the doctor had to be led to my bedside to
make his report. In fact, so exhausted was he, that in
spite of my anxiety I forbore to question him until he had
rested. I venture to say, that both he and his companion
well remember their astonishing performance over
stewed-apples and seal-meat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dogs were not so foot-sore as might have been expected;
but two of them, including poor little Jenny, were
completely knocked up. All attention was bestowed on
indispensable essentials of Arctic search, and soon
they were more happy than their masters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr Hayes had made a due north line on leaving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
brig; but, encountering the &ldquo;squeezed ices&rdquo; of my own
party in March, he wisely worked to the eastward.</p>

<p>On the 22d he encountered a wall of hummocks, exceeding
twenty feet in height, and extending in a long line to
the north-east.</p>

<p>After vain attempts to force them, becoming embarrassed
in fragmentary ice,&mdash;worn, to use his own words, into
&ldquo;deep pits and valleys,&rdquo;&mdash;he was obliged to camp, surrounded
by masses of the wildest character, some of them
thirty feet in height.</p>

<p>The next three days were spent in struggles through
this broken plain; fogs sometimes embarrassed them, but
at intervals land could be seen to the north-west. On the
27th they reached the north side of the bay, passing over
but few miles of new and unbroken floe.</p>

<p>Dr Hayes told me, that in many places they could not
have advanced a step but for the dogs. Deep cavities
filled with snow intervened between lines of ice-barricades,
making their travel as slow and tedious as the same obstructions
had done to the party of poor Brooks before
their eventful rescue last March.</p>

<p>His journal entry, referring to the 23d, while tangled in
the ice, says, &ldquo;I was so snow-blind that I could not see;
and as riding, owing to the jaded condition of the dogs,
was seldom possible, we were obliged to lay-to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not until the 25th that their eyesight was sufficiently
restored to enable them to push on. In these devious
and untrodden ice-fields, even the instinct of the dogs
would have been of little avail to direct their course. It
was well for the party that during this compulsory halt the
temperatures were mild and endurable.</p>

<p>On the 26th, disasters accumulated. William Godfrey,
one of the sturdiest travellers, broke down; and the dogs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
the indispensable reliance of the party, were in bad working
trim. The rude harness, always apt to become tangled
and broken, had been mended so often, and with such imperfect
means, as to be scarcely serviceable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sledge Trappings</div>

<p>This evil would seem the annoyance of an hour to the
travellers in a stage-coach, but to a sledge-party on the ice-waste
it is the gravest that can be conceived. The Esquimaux
dog is driven by a single trace, a long thin thong of
seal or walrus hide, which passes from his chest over his
haunches to the sledge. The team is always driven abreast,
and the traces are of course tangling and twisting themselves
up incessantly, as the half-wild or terrified brutes
bound right or left from their prescribed positions. The
consequence is, that the seven or nine or fourteen lines
have a marvellous aptitude at knotting themselves up beyond
the reach of skill and patience. If the weather is
warm enough to thaw the snow, they become utterly soft
and flaccid, and the naked hand, if applied ingeniously,
may dispense with a resort to the Gordian process; but in
the severe cold, such as I experienced in my winter
journeys of 1854, the knife is often the only appliance,&mdash;an
unsafe one if invoked too often, for every new attachment
shortens your harness, and you may end by drawing
your dogs so close that they cannot pull. I have been
obliged to halt and camp on the open flee, till I could renew
enough of warmth and energy and patience to disentangle
the knots of my harness.</p>

<p>It was only after appropriating an undue share of his
kin breeches that the leader of the party succeeded
in patching up his mutilated dog-lines. He was rewarded,
however, for he shortly after found an old floe, over which
his sledge passed happily to the north coast. It was the
first time that any of our parties had succeeded in penetrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
the area to the north. The ice had baffled three
organized foot-parties. It would certainly never have been
traversed without the aid of dogs; but it is equally certain
that the effort must again have failed, even with their aid,
but for the energy and determination of Dr Hayes, and the
endurance of his partner, William Godfrey.</p>

<p>The party spent the 28th in mending the sledge, which
was completely broken, and feeding up their dogs for a
renewal of the journey. But, their provisions being limited,
Dr Hayes did not deem himself justified in continuing to
the north. He determined to follow and survey the coast
toward Cape Sabine.</p>

<p>His pemmican was reduced to eighteen pounds; there
was apparently no hope of deriving resources from the
hunt; and the coasts were even more covered with snow
than those he had left on the southern side. His return
was a thing of necessity.</p>

<p>Most providentially they found the passage home free
from bergs; but their provisions were nearly gone, and
their dogs were exhausted. They threw away their sleeping-bags,
which were of reindeer-skin and weighed about
twelve pounds each, and abandoned, besides, clothing
enough to make up a reduction in weight of nearly fifty
pounds. With their load so lightened, they were enabled
to make good the crossing of the bay. They landed at
Peter Force Bay, and reached the brig on the 1st of June.</p>

<p>This journey connected the northern coast with the
former surveys; but it disclosed no channel or any form of
exit from this bay.</p>

<p>It convinced me, however, that such a channel must
exist; for this great curve could be no <i>cul-de-sac</i>. Even
were my observations since my first fall-journey of September
1853, not decisive on this head, the general movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
of the icebergs, the character of the tides, and the
equally sure analogies of physical geography, would point
unmistakably to such a conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The North-east Party</div>

<p>To verify it, I at once commenced the organization of a
double party. This, which is called in my Report the
North-east Party, was to be assisted by dogs, but was to
be subsisted as far as the Great Glacier by provisions
carried by a foot-party in advance.</p>

<p>For the continuation of my plans I again refer to my
journal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 2.</i>&mdash;There is still this hundred miles wanting to
the north-west to complete our entire circuit of this frozen
water. This is to be the field for our next party. I am
at some loss how to organize it. For myself, I am down
with scurvy. Dr Hayes is just from the field, worn-out
and snow-blind, and the health-roll of the crew makes a
sorry parade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 3.</i>&mdash;M&rsquo;Gary, Bonsall, Hickey, and Riley were
detailed for the first section of the new parties; they will
be accompanied by Morton, who has orders to keep himself
as fresh as possible, so as to enter on his own line of search
to the greatest possible advantage. I keep Hans a while
to recruit the dogs, and do the hunting and locomotion
generally for the rest of us; but I shall soon let him follow,
unless things grow so much worse on board as to make it
impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am intensely anxious that this party should succeed;
it is my last throw. They have all my views, and I believe
they will carry them out unless overruled by a higher
power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their orders are, to carry the sledge forward as far as
the base of the Great Glacier, and fill up their provisions
from the <i>cache</i> of my own party of last May. Hans will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
then join them with the dogs; and, while M&rsquo;Gary and
three men attempt to scale and survey the glacier, Morton
and Hans will push to the north across the bay with the
dog-sledge, and advance along the more distant coast.
Both divisions are provided with clampers, to steady them
and their sledges on the irregular ice-surfaces; but I am
not without apprehensions that, with all their efforts, the
glacier cannot be surmounted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this event, the main reliance must be on Mr Morton.
He takes with him a sextant, artificial horizon, and pocket
chronometer, and has intelligence, courage, and the spirit
of endurance in full measure. He is withal a long-tried
and trustworthy follower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 5.</i>&mdash;The last party are off; they left yesterday
at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I can do nothing more but await the ice-changes
that are to determine for us our liberation or continued
imprisonment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 6.</i>&mdash;We are a parcel of sick men, affecting to
keep ship till our comrades get back. Except Mr Ohlsen
and George Whipple, there is not a sound man among us.
Thus wearily in our Castle of Indolence, for &lsquo;labour dire
it was, and weary woe,&rsquo; we have been watching the
changing days, and noting bird, insect, and vegetable, as
it tells us of the coming summer. One fly buzzed around
William Godfrey&rsquo;s head to-day,&mdash;he could not tell what
the species was; and Mr Petersen brought in a cocoon
from which the grub had eaten its way to liberty. Hans
gives us a seal almost daily, and for a passing luxury we
have ptarmigan and hare. The little snow-birds have
crowded to Butler Island, and their songs penetrate the
cracks of our rude housing. Another snipe, too, was
mercilessly shot the very day of his arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 10.</i>&mdash;Hans was ordered yesterday to hunt in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
direction of the Esquimaux huts, in the hope of determining
the position of the open water. He did not return
last night; but Dr Hayes and Mr Ohlsen, who were sent
after him this morning with the dog-sledge, found the
hardy savage fast asleep not five miles from the brig.
Alongside of him was a large ussuk or bearded seal, shot,
as usual, in the head. He had dragged it for seven hours
over the ice-foot. The dogs having now recruited, he started
light to join Morton at the glacier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arctic Birds</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 16.</i>&mdash;Two long-tailed ducks visited us, evidently
seeking their breeding-grounds. They are beautiful birds,
either at rest or on the wing. We now have the snow-birds,
the snipe, the burgomaster-gull, and the long-tailed
duck, enlivening our solitude; but the snow-birds are the
only ones in numbers, crowding our rocky islands, and
making our sunny night-time musical with home-remembered
songs. Of each of the others we have but a solitary
pair, who seem to have left their fellows for this far
northern mating-ground in order to live unmolested. I
long for specimens; but they shall not be fired at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 18.</i>&mdash;Mr Ohlsen and Dr Hayes are off on an
overland tramp. I sent them to inspect the open water to
the southward. The immovable state of the ice-foot gives
me anxiety. Last year, a large bay above us was closed all
summer; and the land-ice, as we find it here, is as perennial
as the glacier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 21.</i>&mdash;A snow, moist and flaky, melting upon our
decks, and cleaning up the dingy surface of the great ice-plain
with a new garment. We are at the summer solstice,
the day of greatest solar light! Would that the traditionally-verified
but meteorologically-disproved equinoctial
storm could break upon us, to destroy the tenacious floes!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 22.</i>&mdash;The ice changes slowly, but the progress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
vegetation is excessively rapid. The growth on the rocky
group near our brig is surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 23.</i>&mdash;The eiders have come back: a pair were
seen in the morning, soon followed by four ducks and
drakes. The poor things seemed to be seeking breeding-grounds,
but the ice must have scared them. They were
flying southward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 25.</i>&mdash;Walked on shore and watched the changes:
andromeda in flower, poppy and ranunculus the same: saw
two snipe and some tern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr Ohlsen returned from a walk with Mr Petersen.
They saw reindeer, and brought back a noble specimen of
the king duck. It was a solitary male, resplendent with
the orange, black, and green of his head and neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stephenson is better; and I think that a marked improvement,
although a slow one, shows itself in all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption3">THE NORTH-EAST PARTY.</p>


<p class="p0">&ldquo;<i>June 27.</i>&mdash;M&rsquo;Gary and Bonsall are back with Hickey
and Riley. They arrived last evening: all well, except
that the snow has affected their eyesight badly, owing to
the scorbutic condition of their systems. Mr M&rsquo;Gary is
entirely blind, and I fear will be found slow to cure.
They have done admirably. They bring back a continued
series of observations, perfectly well kept up, for the
further authentication of our survey, and their results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
correspond entirely with those of Mr Sontag and myself.
They are connected, too, with the station at Chimney
Rock, Cape Thackeray, which we have established by
theodolite. I may be satisfied now with our projection of
the Greenland coast. The different localities to the south
have been referred to the position of our winter harbour,
and this has been definitely fixed by the labours of Mr
Sontag, our astronomer. We have, therefore, not only a
reliable base, but a set of primary triangulations, which,
though limited, may support the minor field-work of our
sextants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Gary and Bonsall left the brig on the 3d, and
reached the Great Glacier on the 15th, after only twelve
days of travel. They showed great judgment in passing
the bays; and, although impeded by the heavy snows,
would have been able to remain much longer in the field,
but for the destruction of our provision-depôts by the bears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shooting a Bear</div>

<p>&ldquo;This is evidently the season when the bears are in
most abundance. Their tracks were everywhere, both on
shore and upon the floes. One of them had the audacity
to attempt intruding itself upon the party during one of
their halts upon the ice; and Bonsall tells a good story of
the manner in which they received and returned his salutations.
It was about half an hour after midnight, and they
were all sleeping away a long day&rsquo;s fatigue, when M&rsquo;Gary
either heard or felt, he could hardly tell which, something
that was scratching at the snow immediately by his head.
It waked him just enough to allow him to recognise a huge
animal actively engaged in reconnoitring the circuit of the
tent. His startled outcry aroused his companion inmates,
but without in any degree disturbing the unwelcome
visitor; specially unwelcome at that time and place, for all
the guns had been left on the sledge, a little distance off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">« 102 »</a></span>
and there was not so much as a walking-pole inside.
There was, of course, something of natural confusion in
the little council of war. The first impulse was to make
a rush for the arms; but this was soon decided to be very
doubtfully practicable, if at all; for the bear, having
satisfied himself with his observations of the exterior, now
presented himself at the tent-opening. Sundry volleys of
lucifer matches and some impromptu torches of newspaper
were fired without alarming him, and, after a little while,
he planted himself at the doorway and began making his
supper upon the carcass of a seal which had been shot the
day before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Hickey was the first to bethink him of the military
device of a sortie from the postern, and, cutting a
hole with his knife, crawled out at the rear of the tent.
Here he extricated a boat-hook, that formed one of the
supporters of the ridge-pole, and made it the instrument of
a right valorous attack. A blow well administered on the
nose caused the animal to retreat for the moment a few
paces beyond the sledge, and Tom, calculating his distance
nicely, sprang forward, seized a rifle, and fell back in safety
upon his comrades. In a few seconds more, Mr Bonsall
had sent a ball through and through the body of his enemy.
I was assured that after this adventure the party adhered
to the custom I had enjoined, of keeping at all times a
watch and fire-arms inside the camping-tent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ravages of the Bears</div>

<p>&ldquo;The final <i>cache</i>, which I relied so much upon, was
entirely destroyed. It had been built, with extreme care,
of rocks which had been assembled by very heavy labour,
and adjusted with much aid often from capstan-bars as
levers. The entire construction was, so far as our means
permitted, most effective and resisting. Yet these tigers
of the ice seemed to have scarcely encountered an obstacle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
Not a morsel of pemmican remained except in the iron
cases, which, being round with conical ends, defied both
claw and teeth. They had rolled and pawed them in
every direction, tossing them about like foot-balls, although
over eighty pounds in weight. An alcohol-case, strongly
iron-bound, was dashed into small fragments, and a tin
can of liquor mashed and twisted almost into a ball. The
claws of the beast had perforated the metal, and torn it up
as with a cold chisel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were too dainty for salt-meats: ground coffee
they had an evident relish for: old canvas was a favourite
for some reason or other; even our flag, which had been
reared &lsquo;to take possession&rsquo; of the waste, was gnawed down
to the very staff. They had made a regular frolic of it;
rolling our bread-barrels over the ice-foot and into the
broken outside ice; and, unable to masticate our heavy
India-rubber cloth, they had tied it up in unimaginable
hard knots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Gary describes the whole area around the <i>cache</i> as
marked by the well-worn paths of these animals; and an
adjacent slope of ice-covered rock, with an angle of 45&deg;,
was so worn and covered with their hair, as to suggest the
idea that they had been amusing themselves by sliding
down it on their haunches&mdash;a performance, by the way,
in which I afterward caught them myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 28.</i>&mdash;Hans came up with the party on the 17th.
Morton and he are still out. They took a day&rsquo;s rest; and
then, &lsquo;following the old tracks,&rsquo; as M&rsquo;Gary reports, &lsquo;till
they were clear of the cracks near the islands, pushed
northward at double-quick time. When last seen, they
both of them walking, for the snow was too soft and
deep for them to ride with their heavy load.&rsquo; Fine weather,
but the ice yields reluctantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span></p>

<p>While thus watching the indications of advancing summer,
my mind turned anxiously to the continued absence
of Morton and Hans. We were already beyond the season
when travel upon the ice was considered practicable by
our English predecessors in Wellington Channel, and, in
spite of the continued solidity around us, it was unsafe to
presume too much upon our high northern position.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with no slight joy that on the evening
of the 10th, while walking with Mr Bonsall, a distant
sound of dogs caught my ear. These faithful servants
generally bayed their full-mouthed welcome from afar off,
but they always dashed in with a wild speed which made
their outcry a direct precursor of their arrival. Not so
these well-worn travellers. Hans and Morton staggered
beside the limping dogs, and poor Jenny was riding as a
passenger upon the sledge. It was many hours before
they shared the rest and comfort of our ship.</p>

<p>Mr Morton left the brig with the relief party of M&rsquo;Gary
on the 4th of June. He took his place at the track-lines
like the others; but he was ordered to avoid all extra
labour, so as to husband his strength for the final passage
of the ice.</p>

<p>On the 15th he reached the base of the Great Glacier,
and on the 16th was joined by Hans with the dogs. A
single day was given to feed and refresh the animals, and
on the 18th the two companies parted. Morton&rsquo;s account
I give as nearly as possible in his own words, without
affecting any modification of his style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Morton&rsquo;s Journey</div>

<p>The party left Cache Island at 12.35 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, crossing the
land-ices by portage, and going south for about a mile to
avoid a couple of bad seams caused by the breakage of the
glacier. Here Morton and Hans separated from the land-party,
and went northward, keeping parallel with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
glacier, and from five to seven miles distant. The ice was
free from hummocks, but heavily covered with snow,
through which they walked knee deep. They camped
about eight miles from the glacier.</p>

<p>They started again at half-past nine. The ice at first
was very heavy, and they were frequently over their knees
in the dry snow; but, after crossing certain drifts, it became
hard enough to bear the sledge, and the dogs made
four miles an hour until twenty minutes past four, when
they reached the middle of Peabody Bay. They then
found themselves among the bergs which on former occasions
had prevented other parties from getting through.
These were generally very high, evidently newly separated
from the glacier.</p>

<p>It took them a long while to get through into smoother
ice. A tolerably wide passage would appear between two
bergs, which they would gladly follow; then a narrower
one; then no opening in front, but one to the side. Following
that a little distance, a blank ice-cliff would close the
way altogether, and they were forced to retrace their steps
and begin again. Constantly baffled, but, like true fellows,
determined to &ldquo;go ahead,&rdquo; they at last found a lane some
six miles to the west, which led upon their right course.
But they were from eight o&rsquo;clock at night till two or three
the next morning, puzzling their way out of the maze, like
a blind man in the streets of a strange city.</p>

<p><i>June 19.</i>&mdash;At 8.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> they encamped. Again starting,
they went on for ten miles, but were then arrested by wide
seams in the ice, bergs, and much broken ice; so they turned
about, and reached their last camp by twelve, midnight.
They then went westward, and, after several trials, made a
way, the dogs running well. It took them but two hours
to reach the better ice, for the bergs were in a narrow belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span></p>

<p>They were now nearly abreast of the termination of the
Great Glacier. It was mixed with earth and rocks. The
snow sloped from the land to the ice, and the two seemed
to be mingled together for eight or ten miles to the north,
when the land became solid, and the glacier was lost. The
height of this land seemed about 400 feet, and the glacier
lower.</p>

<p><i>June 21.</i>&mdash;They stood to the north at 11.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and
made for what Morton thought a cape, seeing a vacancy
between it and the West Land. The ice was good, even,
and free from bergs, only two or three being in sight. The
atmosphere became thick and misty, and the west shore,
which they saw faintly on Tuesday, was not visible. They
could only see the cape for which they steered. The cold
was sensibly felt, a very cutting wind blowing north-east
by north. They reached the opening seen to the westward
of the cape by Thursday, 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> It proved to be a channel;
for, as they moved on in the misty weather, a sudden
lifting of the fog showed them the cape and the western
shore.</p>

<p>The ice was weak and rotten, and the dogs began to
tremble. Proceeding at a brisk rate, they had got upon
unsafe ice before they were aware of it. Their course was at
the time nearly up the middle of the channel; but, as soon
as possible, they turned, and, by a backward circuit, reached
the shore. The dogs, as their fashion is, at first lay down
and refused to proceed, trembling violently. The only way
to induce the terrified, obstinate brutes to get on was for
Hans to go to a white-looking spot where the ice was
thicker, the soft stuff looking dark; then, calling the dogs
coaxingly by name, they would crawl to him on their
bellies. So they retreated from place to place, until they
reached the firm ice they had quitted. A half-mile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
brought them to comparatively safe ice, a mile more to
good ice again.</p>

<p>In the midst of this danger they had during the liftings
of the fog sighted open water, and they now saw it plainly.
There was no wind stirring, and its face was perfectly
smooth. It was two miles further up the channel than
the firm ice to which they had retreated. Hans could
hardly believe it. But for the birds that were seen in
great numbers, Morton says he would not have believed it
himself.</p>

<p>The ice covered the mouth of the channel like a horse-shoe.
One end lapped into the west side a considerable
distance up the channel, the other covered the cape for
about a mile and a half, so that they could not land opposite
their camp, which was about a mile and a half from
the cape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ice-foot</div>

<p>That night they succeeded in climbing on to the level
by the floe-pieces, and walked around the turn of the cape
for some distance, leaving their dogs behind. They found
a good ice-foot, very wide, which extended as far as the
cape.</p>

<p>They started again at 11.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> of the 21st. On
reaching the land-ice, they unloaded, and threw each
package of provision from the floe up to the ice-foot, which
was eight or nine feet above them. Morton then climbed
up with the aid of the sledge, which they converted into
a ladder for the occasion. He then pulled the dogs up by
the lines fastened round their bodies, Hans lending a helping
hand and then climbing up himself. They then drew
up the sledge. The water was very deep,&mdash;a stone the
size of Morton&rsquo;s head taking twenty eight seconds to reach
the bottom, which was seen very clearly.</p>

<p>As they had noticed the night before, the ice-foot lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
its good character on reaching the cape, becoming a mere
narrow ledge hugging the cliffs, and looking as if it might
crumble off altogether into the water at any moment.
Morton was greatly afraid there would be no land-ice there
at all when they came back. Hans and he thought they
might pass on by climbing along the face of the crag; in
fact they tried a path about fifty feet high, but it grew so
narrow that they saw they could not get the dogs past with
their sledge-load of provisions. He therefore thought it
safest to leave some food, that they might not starve on the
return in case the ice-foot should disappear. He accordingly
<i>cached</i> enough provision to last them back, with four
days&rsquo; dog-meat.</p>

<p>At the pitch of the cape the ice-ledge was hardly three
feet wide; and they were obliged to unloose the dogs and
drive them forward alone. Hans and he then tilted the
sledge up, and succeeded in carrying it past the narrowest
place. The ice-foot was firm under their tread, though it
crumbled on the verge.</p>

<p>They now yoked in the dogs, and set forward over the
worst sort of mashed ice for three-quarters of a mile.
After passing the cape, they looked ahead, and saw
nothing but open water. After turning the cape, they
found a good smooth ice-foot in the entering curve of a
bay. They came upon glassy ice, and the dogs ran on
it full speed. Here the sledge made at least six miles
an hour. It was the best day&rsquo;s travel they made on the
journey.</p>

<p>The part of the channel they were now coasting was
narrower, but as they proceeded it seemed to widen again.</p>

<p>To the left of this, toward the West Land, the great
channel of open water continued. There was broken ice
floating in it, but with passages fifteen miles in width and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
perfectly clear. The end of the point&mdash;&ldquo;Gravel Point,&rdquo; as
Morton called it&mdash;was covered with hummocks and broken
ice for about two miles from the water. This ice was worn
and full of gravel. Six miles inland the point was flanked
by mountains.</p>

<p>The wind blew strong from the north, and continued to
do so for three days, sometimes blowing a gale, and very
damp, the tops of the hills becoming fixed with dark foggy
clouds. The damp falling mist prevented their seeing any
distance. Yet they saw no ice borne down from the northward
during all this time; and, what was more curious,
they found, on their return south, that no ice had been sent
down during the gale. On the contrary, they then found
the channel perfectly clear from shore to shore.</p>

<p><i>June 22.</i>&mdash;They camped at 8.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on a ledge of
low rock, having made in the day&rsquo;s journey forty-eight
miles in a straight line.</p>

<p><i>June 23.</i>&mdash;In consequence of the gale of wind they did
not start till 12.30 midnight. They made about eight
miles, and were arrested by the broken ice of the shore.
Their utmost efforts could not pass the sledge over this; so
they tied the dogs to it, and went ahead to see how things
looked. They found the land-ice growing worse and worse,
until at last it ceased, and the water broke directly against
the steep cliffs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bear Hunt</div>

<p><i>June 23.</i>&mdash;At 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> they started again, carrying eight
pounds of pemmican and two of bread, besides the artificial
horizon, sextant, and compass, a rifle, and the boat-hook.
After two hours&rsquo; walking the travel improved, and, on
nearing a plain about nine miles from where they had left
the sledge, they were rejoiced to see a she-bear and her
cub. They had tied the dogs securely, as they thought;
but Toodla and four others had broken loose and followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
them, making their appearance within an hour. They were
thus able to attack the bear at once.</p>

<p>Hans, who to the simplicity of an Esquimaux united the
shrewd observation of a hunter, describes the contest which
followed so graphically, that I try to engraft some of the
quaintness of his description upon Mr Morton&rsquo;s report.
The bear fled; but the little one being unable either to
keep ahead of the dogs or to keep pace with her, she turned
back, and putting her head under its haunches, threw it
some distance ahead. The cub safe for the moment, she
would wheel round and face the dogs, so as to give it a
chance to run away; but it always stopped just as it
alighted, till she came up and threw it ahead again: it
seemed to expect her aid, and would not go on without
it. Sometimes the mother would run a few yards ahead,
as if to coax the young one up to her, and when the dogs
came up she would turn on them and drive them back;
then, as they dodged her blows, she would rejoin the cub
and push it on, sometimes putting her head under it, some
times catching it in her mouth by the nape of the neck.</p>

<p>For a time she managed her retreat with great celerity,
leaving the two men far in the rear. They had engaged
her on the land-ice; but she led the dogs in-shore, up a
small stony valley which opened into the interior. But,
after she had gone a mile and a half, her pace slackened,
and, the little one being jaded, she soon came to a halt.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/page111.png" width="459" height="661" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Far North&mdash;<i>Page 111.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span></p>

<p>The men were then only half a mile behind; and, running
at full speed, they soon came up to where the dogs
were holding her at bay. The fight was now a desperate
one. The mother never went more than two yards ahead,
constantly looking at the cub. When the dogs came near
her, she would sit upon her haunches and take the little
one between her hind legs, fighting the dogs with her
paws, and roaring so that she could have been heard a mile
off. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;was an animal more distressed.&rdquo;
She would stretch her neck and snap at the
nearest dog with her shining teeth, whirling her paws like
the arms of a windmill. If she missed her aim, not daring
to pursue one dog lest the others should harm the cub, she
would give a great roar of baffled rage, and go on pawing,
and snapping, and facing the ring, grinning at them with
her mouth stretched wide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of the Bear</div>

<p>When the men came up, the little one was perhaps
rested, for it was able to turn round with her dam, no
matter how quick she moved, so as to keep always in front
of her belly. The five dogs were all the time frisking
about her actively, tormenting her like so many gad-flies;
indeed, they made it difficult to lodge a bullet in her
without killing them. But Hans, lying on his elbow, took
a quiet aim and shot her through the head. She dropped
and rolled over dead without moving a muscle.</p>

<p>The dogs sprang toward her at once; but the cub
jumped upon her body and reared up, for the first time
growling hoarsely. They seemed quite afraid of the little
creature, she fought so actively and made so much noise;
and, while tearing mouthfuls of hair from the dead mother,
they would spring aside the minute the cub turned toward
them. The men drove the dogs off for a time, but were
obliged to shoot the cub at last, as she would not quit the
body.</p>

<p>Hans fired into her head. It did not reach the brain,
though it knocked her down; but she was still able to
climb on her mother&rsquo;s body and try to defend it still, &ldquo;her
mouth bleeding like a gutter-spout.&rdquo; They were obliged
to despatch her with stones.</p>

<p>After skinning the old one they gashed its body, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
dogs fed upon it ravenously. The little one they <i>cached</i>
for themselves on the return; and, with difficulty taking
the dogs off, pushed on, crossing a small bay which
extended from the level ground and had still some broken
ice upon it. Hans was tired out, and was sent on shore
to follow the curve of the bay, where the road was easier.</p>

<p>Morton tried to pass round the cape. It was in vain:
there was no ice-foot; and, trying his best to ascend the
cliffs, he could get up but a few hundred feet. Here he
fastened to his walking-pole the Grinnell flag of the
Antarctic&mdash;a well-cherished little relic, which had now followed
me on two Polar voyages. This flag had been saved
from the wreck of the United States sloop-of-war <i>Peacock</i>,
when she stranded off the Columbia River; it had accompanied
Commodore Wilkes in his far southern discovery of
an Antarctic continent. It was now its strange destiny to
float over the highest northern land, not only of America,
but of our globe. Side by side with this were our masonic
emblems of the compass and the square. He let them fly
for an hour and a half from the black cliff over the dark
rock-shadowed waters, which rolled up and broke in white
caps at its base.</p>

<p>Beyond this cape all is surmise. The high ridges to the
north-west dwindled off into low blue knobs, which blended
finally with the air. Morton called the cape, which baffled
his labours, after his commander; but I have given it the
more enduring name of Cape Constitution.</p>

<p>He was bitterly disappointed that he could not get
round the cape, to see whether there was any land beyond;
but it was impossible. Rejoining Hans, they supped off
their bread and pemmican, and, after a good nap, started
on their return on the 25th, at 1.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ATTEMPT TO REACH BEECHY ISLAND.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">All</span> the sledge-parties were now once more aboard ship,
and the season of Arctic travel had ended. For more than
two months we had been imprisoned in ice, and throughout
all that period, except during the enforced holiday of
the midwinter darkness, or while repairing from actual
disaster, had been constantly in the field. The summer
was wearing on, but still the ice did not break up as it
should. As far as we could see, it remained inflexibly
solid between us and the North Water of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay.
The questions and speculations of those around me began
to show that they too had anxious thoughts for the coming
year. There was reason for all our apprehensions, as some
of my notes may show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prospects of Escape</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 8.</i>&mdash;Penny saw water to the southward in Barrow&rsquo;s
Straits as early as June; and by the first of July the
leads were within a mile of his harbour in Wellington
Channel. Dr Sutherland says he could have cut his way
out by the 15th. Austin was not liberated till the 10th
of August; but the water had worked up to within three
miles and a half of him as early as the 1st, having advanced
twenty miles in the preceding month. If, now, we might
assume that the ice between us and the nearest water
would give way as rapidly as it did in these two cases,&mdash;an
assumption, by the way, which the difference of the
localities is all against, the mouth of our harbour should
be reached in fifty days, or by the last day of August;
and after that, several days, or perhaps weeks, must go by
before the inside ice yields around our brig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know by experience how soon the ice breaks up after
it once begins to go, and I hardly think that it can continue
advancing so slowly much longer. Indeed, I look
for it to open, if it opens at all, about the beginning of
September at furthest, somewhere near the date of Sir
James Ross&rsquo;s liberation at Leopold. But then I have to
remember that I am much further to the north than my
predecessors, and that by the 28th of last August I had
already, after twenty days of unremitting labour, forced the
brig nearly forty miles through the pack, and that the pack
began to close on us only six days later, and that on the
7th of September we were fairly frozen in. Yet last
summer was a most favourable one for ice-melting. Putting
all this together, it looks as if the winter must catch
us before we can get half-way through the pack, even
though we should begin warping to the south at the
earliest moment that we can hope for water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a pleasant conclusion of the argument; for
there never was, and I trust never will be, a party worse
armed for the encounter of a second Arctic winter. We
have neither health, fuel, nor provisions. Dr Hayes, and
indeed all I have consulted about it indirectly, despond at
the thought; and when I look round upon our diseased
and disabled men, and think of the fearful work of the
last long night, I am tempted to feel as they do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The alternative of abandoning the vessel at this early
stage of our absence, even were it possible, would, I feel,
be dishonouring; but, revolving the question as one of
practicability alone, I would not undertake it. In the first
place, how are we to get along with our sick and newly-amputated
men? It is a dreary distance at the best to
Upernavik or Beechy Island, our only seats of refuge, and
a precarious traverse if we were all of us fit for moving,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
but we are hardly one-half in efficiency of what we count
in number. Besides, how can I desert the brig while
there is still a chance of saving her? There is no use
of noting pros and cons: my mind is made up; I will not
do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must examine this ice-field for myself. I have
been maturing through the last fortnight a scheme of relief,
based upon a communication with the English squadron
to the south, and to-morrow I set out to reconnoitre.
Hans will go with me. We will fit out our poor travel-worn
dogs with canvas shoes, and cross the floes to the
true water edge, or at least be satisfied that it is impossible.
&lsquo;He sees best who uses his own eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to the Brig</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 11.</i>&mdash;We got back last night: a sixty miles&rsquo;
journey,&mdash;comfortless enough, with only three hours&rsquo; sleep
on the ice. For thirty-five miles south, the straits are
absolutely tight. Off Refuge Inlet and Esquimaux Point
we found driving leads; but between these points and the
brig not a crack. I pushed the dogs over the drift-ice,
and, after a fair number of mischances, found the North
Water. It was flowing and free; but since M&rsquo;Gary saw
it last May it has not advanced more than four miles. It
would be absurd at this season of the year to attempt
escaping in open boats with this ice between us and water.
All that can be done is to reinforce our energies as we
may, and look the worst in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In view of these contingencies, I have determined to
attempt in person to communicate with Beechy Island, or
at least make the effort. If I can reach Sir Edward
Belcher&rsquo;s squadron, I am sure of all I want. I will take a
light whale-boat, and pick my companions for a journey to
the south and west. I may find perhaps the stores of the
<i>North Star</i> at the Wostenholme Islands, or by great good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
luck come across some passing vessel of the squadron, and
make known our whereabouts and wants; or, failing these,
we will try and coast it along to Wellington Channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A depôt of provisions, and a sea-worthy craft large
enough to carry us&mdash;if I had these, everything would be
right. Even Sir John Ross&rsquo;s launch, the <i>Little Mary</i>,
that he left at Union Bay, would serve our purpose. If I
had her I could make a southern passage after the fall-tides.
The great enemy of that season is the young shore-ice,
that would cut through our frail boats like a saw.
Or, if we can only renew our stock of provisions for the
winter, we may await the chances of next year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a prelude to this solemn undertaking, I met my
officers in the evening, and showed them my ice-charts;
explaining, what I found needed little explanation, the
prospect immediately before us. I then discussed the probable
changes, and, giving them my personal opinion that
the brig might after all be liberated at a later date, I
announced my project. I will not say how gratified I was
with the manner in which they received it. It struck me
that there was a sense of personal relief experienced everywhere.
I told them that I did not choose to call a council
or connect any of them with the responsibilities of the
measure, for it involved only the personal safety of those
who chose to share the risk. Full instructions were then
left for their guidance during my absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the pleasantest interview I ever had with my
associates. I believe every man on board would have
volunteered, but I confined myself to five active men:
James M&rsquo;Gary, William Morton, George Riley, Hans Christian,
and Thomas Hickey, made up my party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our equipment had been getting ready for some time,
though without its object being understood or announced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
The boat was our old <i>Forlorn Hope</i>, mended up and revised
for her new destinies.</p>

<p>Morton, who was in my confidence from the first, had
all our stores ready. We had no game, and no meat but
pork, of which we took some hundred and fifty pounds.
I wanted pemmican, and sent the men out in search of
the cases which were left on the floe by the frozen depôt-party
during the rescue of last March; but they could
not find a trace of them, or indeed of anything else we
abandoned at that time&mdash;a proof, if we wanted one, how
blurred all our faculties must have been by suffering, for
we marked them, as we thought, with marvellous care.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Start</div>

<p>We lifted our boat over the side in the afternoon, and
floated her to the crack at the Observatory Island; mounted
her there on our large sledge <i>The Faith</i>, by an arrangement
of cradles of Mr Ohlsen&rsquo;s devising; stowed in everything
but the provisions, and carried her on to the bluff of
Sylvia Headland; and the next morning a party, consisting
of all but the sick, was detailed to transport her to
open water; while M&rsquo;Gary, Hans, and myself, followed
with our <i>St John&rsquo;s</i> sledge, carrying our stores.</p>

<p>In four days more we had carried the boat across twenty
miles of heavy ice-floe, and launched her in open water.</p>

<p>The straits were much clogged with drift, but I followed
the coast southward without difficulty. We travelled at
night, resting when the sun was hottest. I had every
reason to be pleased with the performance of the whale-boat,
and the men kept up their spirits well. We landed
at the point where we left our life-boat a year ago, and to
our great joy found it untouched: the cove and inlet were
still fast in ice.</p>

<p>We now neared Littleton Island, where a piece of good
fortune awaited us. We saw a number of ducks, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span>
eiders and heraldas; and it occurred to me that by tracking
their flight we should reach their breeding-grounds. There
was no trouble in doing so, for they flew in a straight line
to a group of rocky islets, above which the whole horizon
was studded with birds. A rugged little ledge, which I
named Eider Island, was so thickly colonised that we
could hardly walk without treading on a nest. We
killed with guns and stones over two hundred birds in
a few hours.</p>

<p>We camped at this nursery of wild fowl, and laid in
four large India-rubber bags full, cleaned and rudely
boned. Our boat was hauled up and refitted; and, the
trial having shown us that she was too heavily laden for
safety, I made a general reduction of our stores, and <i>cached</i>
the surplus under the rocks.</p>

<p>On the 19th we left Flagstaff Point, where we fixed our
beacon last year; and stood west 10&deg; south under full
canvas. My aim was to take the channel obliquely at
Littleton Island; and, making the drift-ice or the land to
the south-west in the neighbourhood of Cape Combermere,
push on for Kent Island and leave a cairn there.</p>

<p>Toward night the wind freshened from the northward,
and we passed beyond the protection of the straits into the
open sea-way. My journal gives no picture of the life we
now entered on. The oldest sailor who treads the deck
of his ship with the familiar confidence of a man at home,
has a distrust of open-boat navigation which a landsman
hardly shares. The feeling grew upon us as we lost the
land. M&rsquo;Gary was an old Behring&rsquo;s Straits whaler, and
there is no better boatman in the world than he; but
I know that he shared my doubts, as the boat buried
herself again and again in the trough of a short chopping
sea, which it taxed all his dexterity in steering to meet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span></p>

<p>Baffin passed around this gulf in 1616 with two small
vessels; but they were giants beside ours. I thought of
them as we crossed his track steering for Cape Combermere,
then about sixty miles distant, with every prospect of a
heavy gale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Storm</div>

<p>We were in the centre of this large area of open water
when the gale broke upon us from the north. We were
near foundering. Our false bow of India-rubber cloth
was beaten in, and our frail weather-boarding soon followed
it. With the utmost exertion we could hardly keep
our boat from broaching to: a broken oar or an accidental
twitch would have been fatal to us at any time. But
M&rsquo;Gary handled that whaler&rsquo;s marvel, the long steering-oar,
with admirable skill. None of us could pretend to
take his place. For twenty-two unbroken hours he stuck
to his post without relaxing his attention or his efforts.</p>

<p>I was not prepared for such a storm. I do not think I
have seen a worse sea raised by the northern wind of the Gulf
of Mexico. At last the wind hauled to the eastward, and
we were glad to drive before it for the in-shore floes. We
had passed several bergs; but the sea dashed against their
sides so furiously as to negative all hope of protection at
their base; the pack or floe, so much feared before, was
now looked to for a refuge.</p>

<p>I remember well our anxiety as we entered the loose
streams of drift after four hours&rsquo; scudding, and our relief
when we felt their influence upon the sea. We fastened
to an old floe, not fifty yards in diameter, and, with the
weather-surf breaking over our heads, rode out the storm
under a warp and grapnel.</p>

<p>The obstacle we had now to encounter was the pack that
Stretched between us and the south.</p>

<p>When the storm abated we commenced boring into it,&mdash;slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
work at the best of times; but my companions
encountered it with a persevering activity quite as admirable
as their fortitude in danger. It had its own hazards
too; and more than once it looked as if we were permanently
beset. I myself knew that we might rely on
the southerly wind to liberate us from such an imprisonment;
but I saw that the men thought otherwise, as the
ice-fields closed around us and the horizon showed an
unchanging circle of ice.</p>

<p>A slackening of the ice to the east enabled us after a
while to lay our course for Hakluyt Island. We spread
our canvas again, and reached the in-shore fields by one in
the afternoon. We made our camp, dried our buffalo-skins,
and sunned and slept away our fatigue.</p>

<p>We renewed our labours in the morning. Keeping
inside the pack, we coasted along for the Cary Islands,
encountering now and then a projecting floe, and either
boring or passing around it, but making a satisfactory
progress on the whole toward Lancaster Sound.</p>

<p>For the next three days we worked painfully through
the half-open leads, making in all some fifteen miles to the
south. We had very seldom room enough to row; but,
as we tracked along, it was not difficult to escape nippings,
by hauling up the boat on the ice. Still she received
some hard knocks, and a twist or two that did not help
her sea-worthiness, for she began to leak; and this, with
the rain which fell heavily, forced us to bale her out
every other hour. Of course we could not sleep, and
one of our little party fell sick with the unmitigated
fatigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Gale</div>

<p>On the 29th it came on to blow, the wind still keeping
from the south-west, but cold and almost rising to a gale.
We had had another wet and sleepless night, for the floes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">« 121 »</a></span>
still baffled us by their capricious movements. But at
three in the afternoon we had the sun again, and the ice
opened just enough to tempt us. It was uncomfortable
toil. We pushed forward our little weather-worn craft,
her gunwales touching on both sides, till the toppling ice
began to break down on us, and sometimes, critically
suspended, met above our heads.</p>

<p>One of these passages I am sure we all of us remember.
We were in an alley of pounded ice-masses, such as the
receding floes leave when they have crushed the tables
that were between them, and had pushed our way far
enough to make retreat impossible, when the fields began
to close in. There was no escaping a nip, for everything
was loose and rolling around us, and the floes broke into
hummock-ridges as they came together. They met just
ahead of us, and gradually swayed in toward our boat.
The fragments were already splitting off and spinning over
us, when we found ourselves borne up by the accumulating
rubbish, like the <i>Advance</i> in her winter drift; and, after
resting for twenty minutes high out of water, quietly
lowered again as the fields relaxed their pressure.</p>

<p>Generally, however, the ice-fields came together directly,
and so gradually as to enable us to anticipate their contact.
In such cases, as we were short-handed and our boat
heavily laden, we were glad to avail ourselves of the
motion of the floes to assist in lifting her upon them.
We threw her across the lead by a small pull of the
steering-oar, and let her meet the approaching ice upon
her bow. The effect, as we found in every instance,
was to press her down forward as the floe advanced
against her, and to raise her stern above the level of the
other field. We held ourselves ready for the spring as she
began to rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span></p>

<p>It was a time of almost unbroken excitement; yet I am
not surprised, as I turn over the notes of my meagre diary,
to find how little of stirring incident it records. The
story of one day&rsquo;s strife with the ice-floes might also serve
for those which followed it. I remember that we were four
times nipped before we succeeded in releasing ourselves,
and that we were glad to haul upon the floes as often as a
dozen times a day. We attempted to drag forward on the
occasional fields; but we had to give it up, for it strained
the boat so much that she was barely sea-worthy; it kept
one man busy the last six days bailing her out.</p>

<p>On the 31st, at the distance of ten miles from Cape
Parry, we came to a dead halt. A solid mass lay directly
across our path, extending onward to our furthest horizon.
There were bergs in sight to the westward, and by walking
for some four miles over the moving floe in that direction,
M&rsquo;Gary and myself succeeded in reaching one. We climbed
it to the height of a hundred and twenty feet, and, looking
out from it with my excellent spy-glass to the south and
west, we saw that all within a radius of thirty miles was a
motionless, unbroken, and impenetrable sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ice-Barrier</div>

<p>I had not counted on this. I had met no ice here only
seven days later in 1853. Yet it was plain, that from
Cape Combermere on the west side, and an unnamed bay
immediately to the north of it, across to Hakluyt Island,
there extended a continuous barrier of ice. We had
scarcely penetrated beyond its margin.</p>

<p>We had, in fact, reached the dividing pack of the two
great open waters of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay. The experience of the
whalers and of the expedition-ships that have traversed
this region have made all of us familiar with that great
expanse of open sea, to the north of Cape Dudley Digges,
which has received the name of the North Water. Combining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
the observations of Baffin, Ross, and Inglefield, we
know that this sometimes extends as far north as Littleton
Island, embracing an area of 90,000 square miles. The
voyagers I have named could not, of course, be aware of
the interesting fact that this water is divided, at least
occasionally, into two distinct bodies; the one comprehended
between Lancaster and Jones&rsquo;s Sounds, the other
extending from the point we had now reached to the upper
pack of Smith&rsquo;s Straits. But it was evident to all of our
party that the barrier which now arrested us was made up
of the ices which Jones&rsquo;s Sound on the west and Murchison&rsquo;s
on the east had discharged and driven together.</p>

<p>It was obvious that a further attempt to penetrate to
the south must be hopeless till the ice-barrier before us
should undergo a change. I had observed, when passing
Northumberland Island, that some of its glacier-slopes
were margined with verdure, an almost unfailing indication
of animal life; and, as my men were much wasted with
diarrh&#339;a, and our supplies of food had become scanty, I
resolved to work my way to the island, and recruit there
for another effort.</p>

<p>Tracking and sometimes rowing through a heavy rain,
we traversed the leads for two days, working eastward;
and on the morning of the third gained the open water
near the shore. Here a breeze came to our aid, and in a
couple of hours more we passed with now unwonted
facility to the southern face of the island. We met several
flocks of little auks as we approached it, and found on
landing that it was one enormous homestead of the auks,
dovekies, and gulls.</p>

<p>We encamped on the 31st, on a low beach at the foot of
a moraine that came down between precipitous cliffs of
surpassing wildness. It had evidently been selected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
the Esquimaux for a winter settlement: five well-built
huts of stone attested this. Three of them were still
tolerably perfect, and bore marks of recent habitation.
The droppings of the birds had fertilised the soil, and it
abounded in grasses and sorrel to the water&rsquo;s edge. The
foxes were about in great numbers, attracted, of course,
by the abundance of birds. They were all of them of the
lead-coloured variety, without a white one among them.
The young ones, as yet lean and seemingly unskilled in
hospitable courtesies, barked at us as we walked about.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE SECOND WINTER&mdash;DEPARTURE OF HALF OF THE CREW.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">It</span> was with mingled feelings that we neared the brig.
Our little party had grown fat and strong upon the auks
and eiders and scurvy-grass; and surmises were rife among
us as to the condition of our comrades and the prospects of
our ice-bound ship.</p>

<p>The tide-leads, which one year ago had afforded a precarious
passage to the vessel, now barely admitted our
whale-boat; and, as we forced her through the broken ice,
she showed such signs of hard usage, that I had her hauled
up upon the land-belt and housed under the cliffs at Six-mile
Ravine. We crossed the rocks on foot, aided by our
jumping-poles, and startled our shipmates by our sudden
appearance.</p>

<p>In the midst of the greeting which always met our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
returning parties, and which gave to our little vessel the
endearing associations of a homestead, our thoughts reverted
to the feeble chances of our liberation, and the failure
of our recent effort to secure the means of a retreat.</p>

<p>The brig had been imprisoned by closely-cementing ice
for eleven months, during which period she had not budged
an inch from her icy cradle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cutting the Ice</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 8.</i>&mdash;This morning two saw-lines were passed
from the open-water pools at the sides of our stern-post,
and the ice was bored for blasting. In the course of our
operations the brig surged and righted, rising two and a
half feet. We are now trying to warp her a few yards toward
Butler Island, where we again go to work with our
powder-canisters. The blasting succeeded; one canister
cracked and uplifted 200 square yards of ice with but five
pounds of powder. A prospect showed itself of getting
inside the island at high water; and I determined to attempt
it at the highest spring-tide, which takes place on
the 12th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 12.</i>&mdash;The brig bore the strain of her new position
very well. The tide fell fifteen feet, leaving her high
and dry; but, as the water rose, everything was replaced,
and the deck put in order for warping again. Every one
in the little vessel turned to; and after much excitement,
at the very top of the tide, she passed &lsquo;by the skin of her
teeth.&rsquo; She was then warped in a bight of the floe, neat
Fox-Trap Point, and there she now lies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We congratulated ourselves upon effecting this crossing;
Had we failed, we should have had to remain fast probably
for the high tides a fortnight hence. The young ice is
already forming, and our hopes rest mainly upon the late
gales of August and September.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 15.</i>&mdash;To-day I made another ice-inspection to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
the north-east. The floe on which I have trudged so often,
the big bay-floe of our former mooring, is nearly the same as
when we left it. I recognised the holes and cracks, through
the fog, by a sort of instinct. M&rsquo;Gary and myself had
little difficulty in reaching the Fiord Water by our jumping-poles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my eye on this water, for it may connect with
the north-east headland, and hereafter give us a passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The season travels on: the young ice grows thicker,
and my messmates&rsquo; faces grow longer every day. I have
again to play buffoon to keep up the spirits of the
party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A raven! The snow-birds begin to fly to the south in
groups, coming at night to our brig to hover on the rigging.
Winter is hurrying upon us. The poppies are quite
wilted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Examined ice with Mr Bonsall, and determined to
enter the broken land-ices by warping; not that there is
the slightest probability of getting through, but it affords
moral aid and comfort to the men and officers: it looks as
if we were doing something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 17.</i>&mdash;Warped about 100 yards into the trash,
and, after a long day of labour, have turned in, hoping to
recommence at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to-morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In five days the spring-tides come back; should we
fail in passing with them, I think our fortunes are fixed.
The young ice bore a man this morning: it had a bad look,
this man-supporting August ice! The temperature never
falls below 28&deg;; but it is cold o&rsquo; nights with no fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 18.</i>&mdash;Reduced our allowance of wood to six
pounds a meal. This, among eighteen mouths, is one-third
of a pound of fuel for each. It allows us coffee twice a
day, and soup once. Our fare besides this is cold pork
boiled in quantity and eaten as required. This sort of
thing works badly; but I must save coal for other emergencies.
I see &lsquo;darkness ahead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I inspected the ice again to-day. Bad! bad!&mdash;I must
look another winter in the face. I do not shrink from the
thought; but, while we have a chance ahead, it is my first
duty to have all things in readiness to meet it. It is
<i>horrible</i>&mdash;yes, that is the word!&mdash;to look forward to another
year of disease and darkness, to be met without fresh food
and without fuel. I should meet it with a more tempered
sadness if I had no comrades to think for and protect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hope Abandoned</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 20.</i>&mdash;Rest for all hands. The daily prayer is
no longer, &lsquo;Lord, accept our gratitude, and bless our undertaking,&rsquo;
but, &lsquo;Lord, accept our gratitude, and restore
us to our homes.&rsquo; The ice shows no change: after a boat
and foot journey around the entire south eastern curve of
the bay, no signs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My attempt to reach Beechy Island had disclosed, as I
thought it would, the impossibility of reaching the settlements
of Greenland.</p>

<p>Everything before us was now involved in gloomy doubt.
Hopeful as I had been, it was impossible not to feel that
we were near the climax of the expedition.</p>

<p>I determined to place upon Observatory Island a large
signal-beacon or cairn, and to bury under it documents
which, in case of disaster to our party, would convey to
any who might seek us intelligence of our proceedings and
our fate. The memory of the first winter-quarters of Sir
John Franklin, and the painful feelings with which, while
standing by the graves of his dead, I had five years before
Sought for written signs pointing to the fate of the living,
me careful to avoid a similar neglect.</p>

<p>A conspicuous spot was selected upon a cliff looking
out upon the icy desert, and on a broad face of rock the
words&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0">were painted in letters which could be read at a distance.
A pyramid of heavy stones, perched above it, was marked
with the Christian symbol of the cross. It was not without
a holier sentiment than that of mere utility that I
placed under this the coffins of our two poor comrades.
It was our beacon, and their gravestone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memorials Placed</div>

<p>Near this a hole was worked into the rock, and a paper,
enclosed in glass, sealed in with melted lead. It read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;E. K. Kane, with his comrades, Henry Brooks, John
Wall Wilson, James M&rsquo;Gary, I. I. Hayes, Christian Ohlsen,
Amos Bonsall, Henry Goodfellow, August Sontag, William
Morton, J. Carl Petersen, George Stephenson, Jefferson
Temple Baker, George Riley, Peter Schubert, George
Whipple, John Blake, Thomas Hickey, William Godfrey,
and Hans Christian, members of the Second Grinnell Expedition
in search of Sir John Franklin and the missing
crews of the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, were forced into this
harbour while endeavouring to bore the ice to the north
and east.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were frozen in on the 8th of September 1853,
and liberated&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this period the labours of the expedition have
delineated 960 miles of coast-line, without developing any
traces of the missing ships or the slightest information
bearing upon their fate. The amount of travel to effect
this exploration exceeded 2000 miles, all of which was
upon foot or by the aid of dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Greenland has been traced to its northern face, whence
it is connected with the further north of the opposite
coast by a great glacier. This coast has been charted as
high as lat. 82&deg; 27&#8242;. Smith&rsquo;s Sound expands into a capacious
bay: it has been surveyed throughout its entire
extent. From its northern and eastern corner, in lat. 80&deg;
10&#8242;, long. 66&deg;, a channel has been discovered and followed
until further progress was checked by water free from ice.
This channel trended nearly due north, and expanded into
an apparently open sea, which abounded with birds and
bears and marine life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The death of the dogs during the winter threw the
travel essential to the above discoveries upon the personal
efforts of the officers and men. The summer finds them
much broken in health and strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson Temple Baker and Peter Schubert died from
injuries received from cold while in manly performance of
their duty. Their remains are deposited under a cairn at
the north point of Observatory Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The site of the observatory is 76 English feet from the
northernmost salient point of this island, in a direction
south 14&deg; east. Its position is in lat. 78&deg; 37&#8242; 10&#8243;, long.
70&deg; 40&#8242;. The mean tidal level is 20 feet below the highest
point upon this island. Both of these sites are further
designated by copper bolts, sealed with melted lead into
holes upon the rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 12th of August 1854, the brig warped from her
position, and, after passing inside the group of islands,
fastened to the outer floe about a mile to the north-west,
where she is now awaiting further changes in the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">« 130 »</a></span></p>

<p>The following note was added some hours later:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young ice having formed between the brig and
this island, and prospects of a gale showing themselves,
the date of departure is left unfilled. If possible, a second
visit will be made to insert our dates, our final escape being
still dependent upon the course of the season.</p>

<p class="tdr2">
&ldquo;E. K. Kane.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>And now came the question of the second winter&mdash;how
to look our enemy in the face, and how to meet him.
Anything was better than inaction; and, in spite of the
uncertainty which yet attended our plans, a host of expedients
were to be resorted to, and much Robinson Crusoe
labour ahead. Moss was to be gathered for eking out our
winter fuel, and willow-stems, and stonecrops, and sorrel,
as anti-scorbutics, collected and buried in the snow. But
while all these were in progress came other and graver
questions.</p>

<p>Some of my party had entertained the idea than an
escape to the south was still practicable; and this opinion
was supported by Mr Petersen, our Danish interpreter, who
had accompanied the Searching Expedition of Captain
Penny, and had a matured experience in the changes of
Arctic ice. They even thought that the safety of all would
be promoted by a withdrawal from the brig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 21.</i>&mdash;The question of detaching a party was in
my mind some time ago; but the more I thought it over,
the more I was convinced that it would be neither right in
itself nor practically safe. For myself personally, it is a
simple duty of honour to remain by the brig: I could not
think of leaving her till I had proved the effect of the
later tides; and after that, as I have known all along, it
would be too late. Come what may, I share her fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is a different question with my associates. I
cannot expect them to adopt my impulses; and I am by
no means sure that I ought to hold them bound by my
conclusions. Have I the <i>moral right?</i> for, as to nautical
rules, they do not fit the circumstances; among the whalers,
when a ship is hopelessly beset, the master&rsquo;s authority
gives way, and the crew take counsel for themselves whether
to go or stay by her. My party is subordinate and well-disposed;
but if the restlessness of suffering makes some of
them anxious to brave the chances, they may certainly
plead that a second winter in the ice was no part of the
cruise they bargained for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A New Difficulty</div>

<p>&ldquo;But what presses on me is of another character. I
cannot disguise it from myself that we are wretchedly prepared
for another winter on board. We are a set of
scurvy-riddled, broken-down men; our provisions are sorely
reduced in quantity, and are altogether unsuited to our
condition. My only hope of maintaining or restoring such
a degree of health among us as is indispensable to our
escape in the spring has been and must be in a wholesome,
elastic tone of feeling among the men: a reluctant, brooding,
disheartened spirit would sweep our decks like a
pestilence. I fear the bane of depressing example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all this as a medical man and an officer; and I
feel that we might be wearing away the hearts and energies,
if not the lives of all, by forcing those who were reluctant
to remain. With half a dozen confiding, resolute men, I
no fears of ultimate safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make a thorough inspection of the ice to-morrow,
and decide finally the prospects of our liberation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 23.</i>&mdash;The brig cannot escape. I got an eligible
position with my sledge to review the floes, and returned
this morning at two o&rsquo;clock There is no possibility of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span>
our release, unless by some extreme intervention of the
coming tides. I doubt whether a boat could be forced as
far as the Southern Water. When I think of the extraordinary
way in which the ice was impacted last winter,
how very little it has yielded through the summer, and
how early another winter is making its onset upon us, I am
very doubtful, indeed, whether our brig can get away at all.
It would be inexpedient to attempt leaving her now in
boats&mdash;the water-streams closing, the pack nearly fast again,
and the young ice almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall call the officers and crew together, and make
known to them very fully how things look, and what
hazards must attend such an effort as has been proposed
among them. They shall have my view unequivocally expressed.
I will then give them twenty-four hours to
deliberate; and at the end of that time all who determine
to go shall say so in writing, with a full exposition of the
circumstances of the case. They shall have the best outfit
I can give, an abundant share of our remaining stores, and
my good-bye blessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>August 24.</i>&mdash;At noon to-day I had all hands called,
and explained to them frankly the considerations which
have determined me to remain where we are. I endeavoured
to show them that an escape to open water could
not succeed, and that the effort must be exceedingly
hazardous: I alluded to our duties to the ship; in a word,
I advised them strenuously to forego the project. I then
told them that I should freely give my permission to such
as were desirous of making the attempt, but that I should
require them to place themselves under the command of
officers selected by them before setting out, and to renounce
in writing all claims upon myself and the rest who were
resolved to stay by the vessel. Having done this, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>
directed the roll to be called, and each man to answer for
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division of the Crew</div>

<p>In the result, eight out of the seventeen survivors of my
party resolved to stand by the brig. It is just that I
should record their names. They were Brooks, M&rsquo;Gary,
Wilson, Goodfellow, Morton, Ohlsen, Hickey, and Christian.</p>

<p>I divided to the others their portion of our resources
justly and even liberally; and they left us on Monday, the
28th, with every appliance our narrow circumstances could
furnish to speed and guard them. One of them, George
Riley, returned a few days afterward; but weary months
went by before we saw the rest again. They carried with
them a written assurance of a brother&rsquo;s welcome should
they be driven back; and this assurance was redeemed
when hard trials had prepared them to share again our
fortunes.</p>

<p>The party moved off with the elastic step of men confident
in their purpose, and were out of sight in a few
hours. As we lost them among the hummocks, the stern
realities of our condition pressed themselves upon us anew.
The reduced numbers of our party, the helplessness of
many, the waning efficiency of all, the impending winter,
with its cold dark night, our penury of resources, the
dreary sense of increased isolation,&mdash;these made the staple
of our thoughts. For a time Sir John Franklin and his
party, our daily topic through so many months, gave place
to the question of our own fortunes,&mdash;how we were to
escape, how to live. The summer had gone, the harvest was
ended, and&mdash;- We did not care to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>We were like men driven to the wall, quickened, not
depressed. Our plans were formed at once: there is
nothing like emergency to speed, if not to instruct, the
energies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span></p>

<p>It was my first definite resolve that, come what might,
our organization and its routine of observances should be
adhered to strictly. It is the experience of every man
who has either combated difficulties himself, or attempted
to guide others through them, that the controlling law
shall be systematic action. Nothing depresses and demoralises
so much as a surrender of the approved and
habitual forms of life. I resolved that everything should
go on as it had done. The arrangement of hours, the distribution
and details of duty, the religious exercises, the
ceremonials of the table, the fires, the lights, the watch,
even the labours of the observatory and the notation of the
tides and the sky,&mdash;nothing should be intermitted that had
contributed to make up the day.</p>

<p>My next was to practise on the lessons we had learned
from the Esquimaux. I had studied them carefully, and
determined that their form of habitation and their peculiarities
of diet, without their unthrift and filth, were the
safest and best to which the necessity of our circumstances
invited us.</p>

<p>My journal tells how these resolves were carried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 6.</i>&mdash;We are at it, all hands, sick and well,
each man according to his measure, working at our winter&rsquo;s
home. We are none of us in condition to brave the frost,
and our fuel is nearly out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sledge is to bring us moss and turf from wherever
the men can scrape it. This is an excellent non-conductor;
and when we get the quarter-deck well padded with it, we
shall have a nearly cold-proof covering. Down below we
will enclose a space some eighteen feet square, and pack it
from floor to ceiling with inner walls of the same material.
The floor itself we are calking carefully with plaster of
Paris and common paste, and will cover it, when we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">« 135 »</a></span>
done, with Manilla oakum a couple of inches deep, and a
canvas carpet. The entrance is to be from the hold, by a
low, moss-lined tunnel, the <i>tossut</i> of the native huts, with
as many doors and curtains to close it up as our ingenuity
can devise. This is to be our apartment of all uses,&mdash;not
a very large one; but we are only ten to stow away, and
the closer the warmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 9.</i>&mdash;All hands but the carpenter and Morton
are again out &lsquo;mossing.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seal Hunting</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 10.</i>&mdash;&lsquo;The work goes bravely on.&rsquo; We have
got moss enough for our roof, and something to spare for
below. To-morrow we begin to strip off the outer-deck
planking of the brig, and to stack it for firewood. It is
cold work, hatches open and no fires going; but we saved
time enough for our Sunday&rsquo;s exercises, though we forego
its rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I determined to try a novel expedient for catching
seal. Not more than ten miles to seaward the icebergs
keep up a rude stream of broken ice and water, and the
seals resort there in scanty numbers to breathe. I drove
out with my dogs, taking Hans along; but we found the
spot so hemmed in by loose and fragile ice that there was
no approaching it. The thermometer was 8&deg;, and a light
breeze increased my difficulties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Deo volente</i>, I will be more lucky to-morrow. I am
going to take my long Kentucky rifle, the kayack, an
Esquimaux harpoon with its attached line and bladder,
<i>naligeit</i> and <i>awahtok</i>, and a pair of large snow-shoes to
boot. My plan this time is to kneel where the ice is unsafe,
resting my weight on the broad surface of the snow-shoes,
Hans following astride of his kayack, as a sort of life-preserver
in case of breaking in. If I am fortunate enough
to stalk within gun-range, Hans will take to the water and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">« 136 »</a></span>
secure the game before it sinks. We will be gone for some
days probably, tenting it in the open air; but our sick
men&mdash;that is to say, all of us&mdash;are languishing for fresh
meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started with Hans and five dogs, and in a couple of
hours we emerged upon a plain unlimited to the eye and
smooth as a billiard-table. Feathers of young frosting
gave a plush-like nap to its surface, and toward the horizon
dark columns of frost-smoke pointed clearly to the
open water. This ice was firm enough; our experience
satisfied us that it was not a very recent freezing. We
pushed on without hesitation, cheering ourselves with the
expectation of coming every minute to the seals. We
passed a second ice-growth; it was not so strong as the
one we had just come over, but still safe for a party like
ours. On we went at a brisker gallop, maybe for another
mile, when Hans sang out, at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Pusey!
puseymut! seal, seal!&rdquo; At the same instant the dogs
bounded forward, and, as I looked up, I saw crowds of grey
netsik, the rough or hispid seal of the whalers, disporting
in an open sea of water.</p>

<p>I had hardly welcomed the spectacle when I saw that
we had passed upon a new belt of ice that was obviously
unsafe. To turn was impossible; we had to keep up
our gait. We urged on the dogs with whip and voice, the
ice rolling like leather beneath the sledge-runners; it was
more than a mile to the lump of solid ice. Fear gave to
the poor beasts their utmost speed, and our voices were
soon hushed to silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Serious Accident</div>

<p>This desperate race against fate could not last: the
rolling of the tough salt-water ice terrified our dogs; and
when within fifty paces from the floe they paused. The
left-hand runner went through; our leader &ldquo;Toodlamick&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
followed, and in one second the entire left of the sledge
was submerged. My first thought was to liberate the dogs.
I leaned forward to cut poor Tood&rsquo;s traces, and the next
minute was swimming in a little circle of pasty ice and
water alongside him. Hans, dear good fellow, drew near
to help me, uttering piteous expressions in broken English;
but I ordered him to throw himself on his belly, with his
hands and legs extended, and to make for the island by
cogging himself forward with his jack-knife. In the meantime&mdash;a
mere instant&mdash;I was floundering about with sledge,
dogs, and lines, in confused puddle around me.</p>

<p>I succeeded in cutting poor Tood&rsquo;s lines and letting him
scramble to the ice, for the poor fellow was drowning me
with his piteous caresses, and made my way for the sledge;
but I found that it would not buoy me, and that I had no
resource but to try the circumference of the hole. Around
this I paddled faithfully, the miserable ice always yielding
when my hopes of a lodgment were greatest. During this
process I enlarged my circle of operations to a very uncomfortable
diameter, and was beginning to feel weaker after
every effort. Hans meanwhile had reached the firm ice,
and was on his knees, like a good Moravian, praying
incoherently in English and Esquimaux; at every fresh
crushing-in of the ice he would ejaculate &ldquo;God!&rdquo; and
when I recommenced my paddling he recommenced his
prayers.</p>

<p>I was nearly gone. My knife had been lost in cutting
out the dogs; and a spare one which I carried in my
trouser-pocket was so enveloped in the wet skins that I
could not reach it. I owed my extrication at last to a
newly broken team dog, who was still fast to the sledge,
and in struggling carried one of the runners choke against
the edge of the circle. All my previous attempts to use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
the sledge as a bridge had failed, for it broke through, to
the much greater injury of the ice. I felt that it was a
last chance. I threw myself on my back, so as to lessen
as much as possible my weight, and placed the nape of my
neck against the rim or edge of the ice; then with caution
slowly bent my leg, and, placing the ball of my mocassined
foot against the sledge, I pressed steadily against the
runner, listening to the half-yielding crunch of the ice
beneath.</p>

<p>Presently I felt that my head was pillowed by the ice,
and that my wet fur jumper was sliding up the surface.
Next came my shoulders; they were fairly on. One more
decided push, and I was launched up on the ice and safe.
I reached the ice-floe, and was rubbed by Hans with
frightful zeal. We saved all the dogs; but the sledge,
kayack, tent, gun, snow-shoes, and everything besides, were
left behind.</p>

<p>On reaching the ship, after a twelve-mile trot, I found
so much of comfort and warm welcome that I forgot my
failure. The fire was lit up, and one of our few birds
slaughtered forthwith. It is with real gratitude that I
look back upon my escape, and bless the great presiding
Goodness for the very many resources which remain to us.</p>

<p class="caption3">NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ESQUIMAUX.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">I find</span> that my journal is exceedingly meagre for the
period of our anxious preparations to meet the winter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span>
that I have omitted to mention the course of circumstances
which led us step by step into familiar communication
with the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>My last notice of this strange people, whose fortunes
became afterward so closely connected with our own, was
at the time of Myouk&rsquo;s escape from imprisonment on board
the brig. Although, during my absence on the attempted
visit to Beechy Island, the men I had left behind had
frequent and unrestrained intercourse with them, I myself
saw no natives in Rensselaer Bay till immediately after the
departure of Petersen and his companions. Just then, by
a coincidence which convinced me how closely we had
been under surveillance, a party of three made their appearance,
as if to note for themselves our condition and resources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esquimaux Visitors</div>

<p>When the three visitors came to us near the end of
August, I established them in a tent below deck, with a
copper lamp, a cooking-basin, and a liberal supply of slush
for fuel. I left them under guard when I went to bed at
two in the morning, contentedly eating and cooking and
eating again, without the promise of an intermission. They
repaid my liberality by stealing not only buffalo-robes, the
lamp, boiler, and cooking-pot they had used for the feast,
but Nannook also, my best dog. If the rest of my team
had not been worn down by over-travel, no doubt they
would have taken them all.</p>

<p>The theft of these articles embarrassed me. I was indisposed
to take it as an act of hostility. Their pilferings
before this had been conducted with such a superb
simplicity, the detection followed by such honest explosions
of laughter, that I could not help thinking they had some
law of general appropriation, less removed from the Lycurgan
than the Mosaic code. But it was plain, at least, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
we were now too few to watch our property as we had
done, and that our gentleness was to some extent misunderstood.</p>

<p>I was puzzled how to inflict punishment, but saw that I
must act vigorously, even at a venture. I despatched my
two best walkers, Morton and Riley, as soon as I heard of
the theft of the stores, with orders to make all speed to
Anoatok, and overtake the thieves, who, I thought, would
probably halt there to rest. They found young Myouk
making himself quite comfortable in the hut, in company
with Sievu, the wife of Metek, and Aningnah, the wife of
Marsumah, and the buffalo-robes already tailored into kapetahs
on their backs.</p>

<p>A continued search of the premises recovered the cooking-utensils,
and a number of other things of greater or
less value that we had not missed from the brig. With
the prompt ceremonial which outraged law delights in
among the officials of the police everywhere, the women
were stripped and tied; and then, laden with their stolen
goods and as much walrus-beef besides from their own
stores as would pay for their board, they were marched on
the instant buck to the brig.</p>

<p>The thirty miles was a hard walk for them; but they
did not complain, nor did their constabulary guardians,
who had marched thirty miles already to apprehend them.
It was hardly twenty-four hours since they left the brig
with their booty before they were prisoners in the hold,
with a dreadful white man for keeper, who never addressed
to them a word that had not all the terrors of an unintelligible
reproof, and whose scowl, I flatter myself, exhibited
a well-arranged variety of menacing and demoniacal expressions.</p>

<p>They had not even the companionship of Myouk. Him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
I had despatched to Metek, &ldquo;head-man of Etah, and
others,&rdquo; with the message of a melo-dramatic tyrant, to
negotiate for their ransom. For five long days the women
had to sigh and sing and cry in solitary converse,&mdash;their
appetite continuing excellent, it should be remarked, though
mourning the while a rightfully-impending doom. At last
the great Metek arrived. He brought with him Ootuniah,
another man of elevated social position, and quite a sledge-load
of knives, tin cups, and other stolen goods, refuse of
wood and scraps of iron, the sinful prizes of many covetings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace-Offerings</div>

<p>I may pass over our peace conferences and the indirect
advantages which I, of course, derived from having the
opposing powers represented in my own capital. But the
splendours of our Arctic centre of civilisation, with its
wonders of art and science,&mdash;our &ldquo;fire-death&rdquo; ordnance
included,&mdash;could not all of them impress Metek so much
as the intimations he had received of our superior physical
endowments. Nomads as they are, these people know
better than all the world besides what endurance and
energy it requires to brave the moving ice and snow-drifts.
Metek thought, no doubt, that our strength was gone with
the withdrawing party; but the fact that, within ten hours
after the loss of our buffalo-skins, we had marched to their
hut, seized three of the culprits, and marched them back
to the brig as prisoners,&mdash;such a sixty miles&rsquo; achievement
as this they thoroughly understood. It confirmed them in
the faith that the whites are, and of right ought to be,
everywhere the dominant tribe.</p>

<p>The protocol was arranged without difficulty, though
not without the accustomed number of adjournments for
festivity and repose. It abounded in protestations of
power, fearlessness, and good will by each of the contracting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">« 142 »</a></span>
parties, which meant as much as such protestations
usually do on both sides the Arctic circle. I could give a
summary of it without invading the privacy of a diplomatic
bureau, for I have notes of it that were taken by a subordinate;
but I prefer passing at once to the reciprocal engagements
in which it resulted.</p>

<p>On the part of the Esquimaux, they were after this
fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We promise that we will not steal. We promise we
will bring you fresh meat. We promise we will sell or
lend you dogs. We will keep you company whenever you
want us, and show you where to find the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the part of the white men, the stipulation was of this
ample equivalent:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We promise that we will not visit you with death or
sorcery, nor do you any hurt or mischief whatsoever. We
will shoot for you on our hunts. You shall be made welcome
aboard ship. We will give you presents of needles,
pins, two kinds of knife, a hoop, three bits of hard wood,
some fat, an awl, and some sewing-thread; and we will
trade with you of these and everything else you want, for
walrus and seal-meat of the first quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This treaty&mdash;which, though I have spoken of it jocosely,
was really an affair of much interest to us&mdash;was ratified,
with Hans and Morton as my accredited representatives,
by a full assembly of the people at Etah. All our future
intercourse was conducted under it. It was not solemnised
by an oath, but it was never broken. We went to and
fro between the villages and the brig, paid our visits of
courtesy and necessity on both sides, met each other in
hunting-parties on the floe and the ice-foot, organized a
general community of interests, and really, I believe,
established some personal attachments deserving of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">« 143 »</a></span>
name. As long as we remained prisoners of the ice, we
were indebted to them for invaluable counsel in relation
to our hunting expeditions; and in the joint hunt we
shared alike, according to their own laws. Our dogs were
in one sense common property; and often have they
robbed themselves to offer supplies of food to our starving
teams. They gave us supplies of meat at critical periods;
we were able to do as much for them. They learned to
look on us only as benefactors; and, I know, mourned our
departure bitterly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celebration of the Treaty</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 17.</i>&mdash;Writing by this miserable flicker of
my pork-fat lamp, I can hardly steady pen, paper, or
thought. All hands have rested after a heavy week&rsquo;s work,
which has advanced us nobly in our arrangements for the
winter. The season is by our tables at least three weeks
earlier than the last, and everything indicates a severe
ordeal ahead of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as we were finishing our chapter this morning in
the &lsquo;Book of Ruth,&rsquo; M&rsquo;Gary and Morton, who had been to
Anoatok, came in triumphantly, pretty well worn down by
their fifty miles&rsquo; travel, but with good news, and a flipper
of walrus that must weigh some forty pounds. Ohlsen
and Hans are in too. They arrived as we were sitting
down to celebrate the Anoatok ratification of our treaty
of the 6th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a strange life we are leading. We are absolutely
nomads, so far as there can be anything of pastoral life in
this region; and our wild encounter with the elements
seems to agree with us all. Our table-talk at supper was
as merry as a marriage bell. One party was just in from
a seventy-four miles&rsquo; trip with the dogs; another from a
journey of a hundred and sixty, with five nights on
the floe. Each had his story to tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 20.</i>&mdash;The natives are really acting up to contract.
They are on board to-day, and I have been off with
a party of them on a hunt inland. We had no great luck;
the weather was against us, and there are signs of a gale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My next extracts show the progress of our winter
arrangements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>September 30.</i>&mdash;We have been clearing up on the ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to our allies the Esquimaux, our beef-house
is now a pile of barrels holding our water-soaked beef and
pork. Flour, beans, and dried apples make a quadrangular
blockhouse on the floe; from one corner of it rises our
flagstaff, lighting up the dusky grey with its red and white
ensign, only on Sunday giving place to the Henry Grinnell
flag, of happy memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this, along an avenue that opens abeam of the
brig,&mdash;New London Avenue, named after M&rsquo;Gary&rsquo;s town
at home,&mdash;are our boats and square cordage. Outside of
all these is a magnificent hut of barrel-frames and snow, to
accommodate our Esquimaux visitors&mdash;the only thing
about it exposed to hazard being the tempting woodwork.
What remains to complete our camp-plot is the rope barrier
that is to mark out our little curtilage around the vessel;
this, when finished, is to be the dividing-line between us
and the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in the simplicity of all this <i>simplex
munditiis</i>, which might commend itself to the most rigorous
taste. Nothing is wasted on ornament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 4.</i>&mdash;I sent Hans and Hickey two days ago out
to the hunting-ice, to see if the natives have had any luck
with the walrus. They are back to-night with bad news,&mdash;no
meat, no Esquimaux. These strange children of the
snow have made a mysterious flitting&mdash;where or how it is
hard to guess, for they have no sledges. They cannot have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
travelled very far; and yet they have such unquiet impulses,
that, once on the track, no civilised man can say
where they will bring up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ohlsen had just completed a sledge, fashioned like the
Smith Sound <i>kommetik</i>, with an improved curvature of the
runners. It weighs only twenty-four pounds, and, though
I think it too short for light draught, it is just the article
our Etah neighbours would delight in for their land-portages.
I intended it for them, as a great price for a
great stock of walrus-meat; but the other parties to the
bargain have flown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Search for Food</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 5.</i>&mdash;We are nearly out of fresh meat again, one
rabbit and three ducks being our sum total. We have
been on short allowance for several days. What vegetables
we have&mdash;the dried apples and peaches, and pickled cabbage&mdash;have
lost much of their anti-scorbutic virtue by
constant use. Our spices are all gone. Except four small
bottles of horse-radish, our <i>carte</i> is comprised in three
lines&mdash;bread, beef, pork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be off after these Esquimaux. They certainly
have meat, and wherever they have gone we can follow.
Once upon their trail, our hungry instincts will not risk
being baffled. I will stay only long enough to complete
my latest root-beer brewage. Its basis is the big crawling
willow, the miniature giant of our Arctic forests, of which
we laid in a stock some weeks ago. It is quite pleasantly
bitter, and I hope to get it fermenting in the deck-house
without extra fuel, by heat from below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bear Encounter</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 7.</i>&mdash;Lively sensation, as they say in the land
of olives and champagne. &lsquo;Nannook, nannook!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A bear,
a bear!&rsquo;&mdash;Hans and Morton in a breath!</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the scandal of our domestic regulations, the guns
were all impracticable. While the men were loading and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
capping anew, I seized my pillow-companion six-shooter,
and ran on deck. A medium-sized bear, with a four
months&rsquo; cub, was in active warfare with our dogs. They
were hanging on her skirts, and she with wonderful alertness
was picking out one victim after another, snatching him by
the nape of the neck, and flinging him many feet, or rather
yards, by a barely perceptible movement of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lodged a pistol-ball in the side of the cub. Ohlsen
wounded the mother as she went, but she scarcely noticed
it. She tore down, by single efforts of her forearms, the
barrels of frozen beef which made the triple walls of the
storehouse, mounted the rubbish, and snatching up a half
barrel of herrings, carried it down by her teeth, and was
making off. It was time to close, I thought. Going up
within half-pistol range, I gave her six buckshot. She
dropped, but instantly rose, and, getting her cub into its
former position, moved off once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time she would really have escaped but for the
admirable tactics of our new recruits from the Esquimaux.
The dogs of Smith&rsquo;s Sound are educated more thoroughly
than any of their southern brethren. Next to the walrus,
the bear is the staple of diet to the north, and except the
fox, supplies the most important element of the wardrobe.
Unlike the dogs we had brought with us from Baffin&rsquo;s
Bay, these were trained, not to attack, but to embarrass.
They ran in circles round the bear, and when pursued
would keep ahead with regulated gait, their comrades
effecting a diversion at the critical moment by a nip at her
hind-quarters. This was done so systematically, and with so
little seeming excitement, as to strike every one on board.
I have seen bear-dogs elsewhere that had been drilled to
relieve each other in the <i>melée</i> and avoid the direct assault
but here, two dogs without even a demonstration of attack,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
would put themselves before the path of the animal, and
retreating right and left, lead him into a profitless pursuit
that checked his advance completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor animal was still backing out, yet still fighting,
carrying along her wounded cub, embarrassed by the
dogs, yet gaining distance from the brig, when Hans and
myself threw in the odds in the shape of a couple of rifle-balls.
She staggered in front of her young one, faced us
in death like defiance, and only sank when pierced by six
more bullets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little cub sprang upon the corpse of her mother,
and raised a woeful lamentation over her wounds. She
repelled my efforts to noose her with great ferocity; but at
last, completely muzzled with a line fastened by a running
knot between her jaws and the back of her head, she
moved off to the brig amid the clamour of the dogs. We
have her now chained alongside, but snarling and snapping
constantly, evidently suffering from her wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 8.</i>&mdash;When I was out in the <i>Advance</i>, with
Captain de Haven, I satisfied myself that it was a vulgar
prejudice to regard the liver of the bear as poisonous. I
ate of it freely myself, and succeeded in making it a
favourite dish with the mess. But I find to my cost that
it may sometimes be more savoury than safe. The cub&rsquo;s
liver was my supper last night, and to-day I have the
symptoms of poison in full measure&mdash;vertigo, diarrh&#339;a,
and their concomitants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 10.</i>&mdash;If I was asked what, after darkness and
cold and scurvy, are the three besetting curses of our
Arctic sojourn, I should say, <span class="smcap">Rats, Rats, Rats</span>. A
mother-rat bit my finger to the bone last Friday, as I was
intruding my hand into a bear-skin mitten which she had
chosen as a homestead for her little family. I withdrew it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
of course with instinctive courtesy; but among them they
carried off the mitten before I could suck the finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last week I sent down Rhina, the most intelligent
dog of our whole pack, to bivouac in their citadel forward;
I thought she might at least be able to defend herself
against them, for she had distinguished herself in the bear-hunt.
She slept very well for a couple of hours on a bed
she had chosen for herself on the top of some iron spikes.
But the rats could not or would not forego the horny skin
about her paws; and they gnawed her feet and nails so
ferociously, that we drew her up yelping and vanquished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 13.</i>&mdash;The Esquimaux have not been near us,
and it is a puzzle of some interest where they have retreated
to. Wherever they are, there must be our hunting-grounds,
for they certainly have not changed their
quarters to a more destitute region. I have sent Morton
and Hans to-day to track them out if they can. They
carry a hand-sledge with them, Ohlsen&rsquo;s last manufacture,
ride with the dog-sledge as far as Anoatok, and leave the
old dogs of our team there. From that point they are to
try a device of my own. We have a couple of dogs that
we got from these same Esquimaux, who are at least as
instinctive as their former masters. One of these they are
to let run, holding the other by a long leash. I feel confident
that the free dog will find the camping-ground, and
I think it probable the other will follow. I thought of
tying the two together; but it would embarrass their
movements, and give them something to occupy their
minds, besides the leading object of their mission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intense Cold</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 14.</i>&mdash;Wilson and Hickey reported last night a
wolf at the meat-house. Now, the meat-house is a thing
of too much worth to be left to casualty, and a wolf might
incidentally add some freshness of flavour to its contents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
So I went out in all haste with the Marston rifle, but
without my mittens, and with only a single cartridge. The
metal burnt my hands, as metal is apt to do at 50&deg; below
the point of freezing; but I got a somewhat rapid shot. I
hit one of our dogs, a truant from Morton&rsquo;s team; luckily
a flesh wound only, for he is too good a beast to lose. I
could have sworn he was a wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 19.</i>&mdash;Our black dog Erebus has come back to
the brig. Morton has perhaps released him, but he has
more probably broken loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 21.</i>&mdash;Hard at it still, slinging chains and
planting shores. The thermometer is too near zero for
work like this. We swaddle our feet in old cloth, and
guard our hands with fur mits; but the cold iron bites
through them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;6.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Morton and Hans are in, after tracking
the Esquimaux to the lower settlement of Etah. I cannot
give their report to-night: the poor fellows are completely
knocked up by the hardships of their march. Hans, who
is always careless of powder and fire arms,&mdash;a trait which
I have observed among both the American and the Oriental
savages,&mdash;exploded his powder-flask while attempting to
kindle a tinder fire. The explosion has risked his hand.
I have dressed it, extracting several pieces of foreign matter,
and poulticing it in yeast and charcoal. Morton has
frost-bitten both his heels; I hope not too severely, for the
indurated skin of the heel makes it a bad region for suppuration.
But they bring us two hundred and seventy
pounds of walrus-meat, and a couple of foxes. This supply,
with what we have remaining of our two bears, must last
us till the return of daylight allows us to join the natives
in their hunts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light is fast leaving us. The sun has ceased to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
reach the vessel. The north-eastern headlands, or their
southern faces up the fiords, have still a warm yellow tint,
and the pinnacles of the icebergs far out on the floes are
lighted up at noonday; but all else is dark shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE ESQUIMAUX VILLAGE&mdash;A WALRUS HUNT.</p>


<p class="p0">Morton reached the huts beyond Anoatok upon the fourth
day after leaving the brig.</p>

<p>There were four of them, but two of them are in ruins.
They were all of them the homes of families only four
winters ago. Of the two which are still habitable, Myouk,
his father, mother, brother and sister occupied one; and
Awahtok and Ootuniah, with their wives and three young
ones, the other. The little community had lost two of its
members by death since the spring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Esquimaux Hut</div>

<p>They received Morton and his companions with much
kindness, giving them water to drink, rubbing their feet,
drying their moccasins, and the like. The women, who
did this, with something of the goodwife&rsquo;s air of prerogative,
seemed to have toned down much of the rudeness which
characterised the bachelor settlement at Anoatok. The
lamps were cheerful and smokeless, and the huts much
less filthy. Each had its two lamps constantly burning,
with a framework of bone-hooks and walrus-line above
them for drying the wet clothes of the household. Except
a few dog-skins, which are used as a support to the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">« 151 »</a></span>
of the back, the dais was destitute of sleeping accommodations
altogether: a single walrus-hide was spread out for
Morton and Hans. The hut had the usual <i>tossut</i>, or entrance
passage, at least twelve feet long&mdash;very low, straight,
and level, until it reached the inner part of the chamber,
when it rose abruptly by a small hole, through which with
some squeezing was the entrance into the true apartment.
Over this entrance was the rude window, with its scraped
seal-intestine instead of glass, heavily coated with frost of
course; but a small eye-hole commanding the bay enabled
the indwellers to peep out and speak or call to any who
were outside. A smoke-hole passed through the roof.</p>

<p>When all the family, with Morton and Hans, were
gathered together, the two lamps in full blaze, and the
narrow hole of entrance covered by a flat stone, the heat
became insupportable. Outside, the thermometer stood at
30&deg; below zero; within, 90&deg; above; a difference of 120&deg;.</p>

<p>The vermin were not as troublesome as in the Anoatok
dormitory, the natives hanging their clothing over the
lamp-frames, and lying down to sleep perfectly naked, with
the exception of a sort of T bandage, as surgeons call it, of
seal-skin, three inches wide, worn by the women as a badge
of their sex, and supported by a mere strip around the hips.</p>

<p>After sharing the supper of their hosts, the visitors
stretched themselves out and passed the night in unbroken
perspiration and slumber. It was evident from the meagreness
of the larder that the hunters of the family had work
to do; and from some signs, which did not escape the
sagacity of Morton, it was plain that Myouk and his father
had determined to seek their next dinner upon the floes.
They were going upon a walrus hunt; and Morton, true to
the mission with which I had charged him invited himself
and Hans to be of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span></p>

<p>I have not yet described one of these exciting incidents
of Esquimaux life. Morton was full of the one he witnessed;
and his account of it when he came back was
so graphic, that I shall be glad to escape from the egotism
of personal narrative by giving it in his own words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walrus Hunting</div>

<p>The party which he attended upon their walrus hunt
had three sledges. One was to be taken to a <i>cache</i> in the
neighbourhood; the other two dragged at a quick run toward
the open water, about ten miles off to the south-west.
They had but nine dogs to these two sledges, one man
only riding, the others running by turns. As they neared
the new ice, and where the black wastes of mingled cloud
and water betokened the open sea, they would from time
to time remove their hoods and listen intently for the
animal&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>After a while Myouk became convinced, from signs or
sounds, or both,&mdash;for they were inappreciable by Morton,&mdash;that
the walrus were waiting for him in a small space of
recently-open water that was glazed over with a few days&rsquo;
growth of ice; and moving gently on, they soon heard its
characteristic bellow. The walrus, like some of the higher
order of beings to which he has been compared, is fond of
his own music, and will lie for hours listening to himself.
His vocalisation is something between the mooing of a cow
and the deepest baying of a mastiff: very round and full,
with its barks or detached notes repeated rather quickly
seven to nine times in succession.</p>

<p>The party now formed in single file, following in each
other&rsquo;s steps, and, guided by an admirable knowledge of
ice-topography, wound behind hummocks and ridges in a
serpentine approach toward a group of pond-like discolourations,
recently-frozen ice-spots, but surrounded by firmer
and older ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span></p>

<p>When within half a mile of these, the line broke, and
each man crawled toward a separate pool&mdash;Morton on his
hands and knees following Myouk. In a few minutes the
walrus were in sight. They were five in number, rising at
intervals through the ice in a body, and breaking it up
with an explosive puff that might have been heard for
miles. Two large grim-looking males were conspicuous as
the leaders of the group.</p>

<p>Now for the marvel of the craft. When the walrus is
above water, the hunter is flat and motionless; as he begins
to sink, alert and ready for a spring. The animal&rsquo;s head
is hardly below the water-line before every man is in a
rapid run; and again, as if by instinct, before the beast
returns, all are motionless behind protecting knolls of ice.
They seem to know beforehand not only the time he will
be absent, but the very spot at which he will re-appear.
In this way, hiding and advancing by turns, Myouk, with
Morton at his heels, has reached a plate of thin ice, hardly
strong enough to bear them, at the very brink of the water-pool
the walrus are curvetting in.</p>

<p>Myouk, till now phlegmatic, seems to waken with excitement.
His coil of walrus-hide, a well-trimmed line of
many fathoms&rsquo; length, is lying at his side. He fixes one
end of it in an iron barb, and fastens this loosely by a
socket upon a shaft of unicorn&rsquo;s horn; the other end is
already looped, or, as sailors would say, &ldquo;doubled in a
bight.&rdquo; It is the work of a moment. He has grasped
the harpoon; the water is in motion. Puffing with
pent-up respiration, the walrus is within a couple of
fathoms close before him. Myouk rises slowly&mdash;his right
arm thrown back, the left flat at his side. The walrus
looks about him, shaking the water from his crest; Myouk
throws up his left arm, and the animal, rising breast high,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
fixes one look before he plunges. It has cost him all that
curiosity can cost; the harpoon is buried under his left
flipper.</p>

<p>Though the walrus is down in a moment, Myouk is
running at desperate speed from the scene of his victory,
paying off his coil freely, but clutching the end by its loop.
He seizes as he runs a small stick of bone, rudely pointed
with iron, and by a sudden movement drives it into the
ice; to this he secures his line, pressing it down close to
the ice-surface with his feet.</p>

<p>Now comes the struggle. The hole is dashed in mad
commotion with the struggles of the wounded beast; the
line is drawn tight at one moment, the next relaxed: the
hunter has not left his station. There is a crash of the
ice; and rearing up through it are two walruses, not many
yards from where he stands. One of them, the male, is
excited and seemingly terrified; the other, the female, collected
and vengeful. Down they go again, after one grim
survey of the field; and on the instant Myouk has changed
his position, carrying his coil with him and fixing it anew.</p>

<p>He has hardly fixed it before the pair have again risen,
breaking up an area of ten feet diameter about the very
spot he left. As they sink once more he again changes his
place. And so the conflict goes on between address and
force, till the victim, half exhausted, receives a second
wound, and is played like a trout by the angler&rsquo;s reel.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the ferocity of the walrus,
from the fact that the battle which Morton witnessed, not
without sharing some of its danger, lasted four hours&mdash;during
which the animal rushed continually at the Esquimaux
as they approached, tearing off great tables of ice
with his tusks, and showing no indications of fear whatever.
He received upward of seventy lance-wounds,&mdash;Morton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
counted over sixty; and even then he remained
hooked by his tusks to the margin of the ice, unable or
unwilling to retire. His female fought in the same manner,
but fled on receiving a lance-wound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Close of the Fight</div>

<p>The Esquimaux seemed to be fully aware of the danger
of venturing too near; for at the first onset of the walrus
they jumped back far enough to be clear of the broken ice.
Morton described the last three hours as wearing, on both
sides, the aspect of an unbroken and seemingly doubtful
combat.</p>

<p>The method of landing the beast upon the ice, too,
showed a great deal of clever contrivance. They made two
pair of incisions in the neck, where the hide is very thick,
about six inches apart and parallel to each other, so as to
form a couple of bands. A line of cut hide, about a quarter
of an inch in diameter, was passed under one of these
bands and carried up on the ice to a firm stick well secured
in the floe, where it went through a loop, and was then
taken back to the animal, made to pass under the second
band, and led off to the Esquimaux. This formed a sort
of &ldquo;double purchase,&rdquo; the blubber so lubricating the cord
as to admit of a free movement. By this contrivance the
beast, weighing some seven hundred pounds, was hauled
up and butchered at leisure.</p>

<p>The two sledges now journeyed homeward, carrying the
more valued parts of their prize. The intestines and a
large share of the carcass were buried up in the cavities of
a berg; Lucullus himself could not have dreamed of a
grander icehouse.</p>

<p>As they doubled the little island which stood in front of
their settlement, the women ran down the rocks to meet
them. A long hail carried the good news; and, as the
party alighted on the beach, knives were quickly at work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
the allotment of the meat being determined by well-understood
hunter laws. The Esquimaux, however gluttonously
they may eat, evidently bear hunger with as little difficulty
as excess. None of the morning party had breakfasted;
yet it was after ten o&rsquo;clock at night before they sat down
to dinner. &ldquo;Sat down to dinner!&rdquo; This is the only
expression of our own gastrology which is applicable to an
Esquimaux feast. They truly sit down, man, woman, and
child, knife in hand, squatting cross-legged around a formidable
joint,&mdash;say forty pounds,&mdash;falling to like college
commoners after grace. I have seen many such feeds.
Hans&rsquo;s account, however, of the glutton-festival is too characteristic
to be omitted:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Cappen Ken, sir, even the children ate all night;
you know the little two-year-old that Awiu carried in her
hood&mdash;the one that bit you when you tickled it? Yes.
Well, Cappen Ken, sir, that baby cut for herself, with a
knife made out of an iron hoop, and so heavy that it could
barely lift it, and cut and ate, and ate and cut, as long as
I looked at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hans, try now and think; for I want an accurate
answer: how much as to weight or quantity would you say
that child ate?&rdquo; Hans is an exact and truthful man: he
pondered a little and said that he could not answer my
question. &ldquo;But I know this, sir, that it ate a <i>sipak</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the
Esquimaux name for the lump which is cut off close to the
lips&mdash;&ldquo;as large as its own head; and three hours afterward,
when I went to bed, it was cutting off another lump
and eating still.&rdquo; A sipak, like the Dutch governor&rsquo;s foot,
is, however, a varying unit of weight.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE COMING WINTER.</p>


<p class="p0">&ldquo;<i>October 26.</i>&mdash;The thermometer at 34&deg; below zero, but
fortunately no wind blowing. We go on with the outdoor
work. We burn but seventy pounds of fuel a day,
most of it in the galley&mdash;the fire being allowed to go out
between meals. We go without fire altogether for four
hours of the night; yet such is the excellence of our moss-walls
and the air-proof of our <i>tossut</i>, that, when our housing
is arranged, and the main hatch secured with a proper
weather-tight screen of canvas, we shall be able, I hope,
to meet the extreme cold of February and March without
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkness is the worst enemy we have to face; but
we will strive against the scurvy in spite of him, till the
light days of sun and vegetation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilson and Brooks are my principal subjects of
anxiety; for although Morton and Hans are on their
backs, making four of our ten, I can see strength of system
in their cheerfulness of heart. The best prophylactic is a
hopeful, sanguine temperament; the best cure, moral
resistance&mdash;that spirit of combat against every trial, which
is alone true bravery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fuel for the Winter</div>

<p>&ldquo;October 27.&mdash;The work is going on; we are ripping
off the extra planking of our deck for fuel during the
winter. The cold increases fast, and in spite of all my
efforts we will have to burn largely into the brig. I
prepared for this two months ago, and satisfied myself,
after a consultation with the carpenter, that we may cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
away some seven or eight tons of fuel without absolutely
destroying her sea-worthiness.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My narrative has now reached a period at which everything
like progress was suspended. The increasing cold
and brightening stars,&mdash;the labours, anxieties, and sickness
that pressed upon us,&mdash;these almost engross the pages
of my journal. Now and then I find some marvel such
as Petersen&rsquo;s about the fox&rsquo;s dexterity as a hunter; Hans
tells me of domestic life in South Greenland, or of a seal-hunt
and a wrecked kayack; or perhaps M&rsquo;Gary repeats
his thrice-told tale of humour; but the night has closed
down upon us, and we are hibernating through it.</p>

<p>Yet some of these are topics of interest. The intense
beauty of the Arctic firmament can hardly be imagined.
It looks close above our heads, with its stars magnified
in glory, and the very planets twinkling so much as to
baffle the observations of our astronomer. I am afraid to
speak of some of these night-scenes. I have trodden the
deck and the floes, when the life of earth seemed suspended,&mdash;its
movements, its sounds, its colouring, its companionships;
and as I looked on the radiant hemisphere,
circling above me as if rendering worship to the unseen
centre of light, I have ejaculated in humility of spirit,
&ldquo;Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him?&rdquo;
And then I have thought of the kindly world we had left,
with its revolving sunshine and shadow, and the other
stars that gladden it in their changes, and the hearts that
warmed to us there, till I lost myself in memories of
those who are not&mdash;and they bore me back to the stars
again.</p>

<p>The narration of one day&rsquo;s hopes and fears, troubles,
privations, and trials,&mdash;I am sorry I cannot add triumphs,&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span>
much resembles that of the next, that I feel it
would be but tiring the patience of the reader were I to
detail, with the same degree of minuteness which I have
hitherto done, the daily progress of our little party, and
the great cause in which we are engaged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Despondency</div>

<p>The winter is now upon us, and little or nothing can be
done either to effect the liberation of the brig from her icy
fetters, or to further our explorations.</p>

<p>On board the brig the mode of life is the same as last
winter, except that we are subject to greater privations,
consequent on the great demands which have been made
upon the stores. We have little to amuse ourselves, and
we go through the monotonous round of the day&rsquo;s duties
with as much celerity and ready will, as our drooping
circumstances will admit of.</p>

<p>I cannot hide from myself the fact that the main object
of our expedition must now be finally abandoned; and
our duty, in the next instance, is toward ourselves: to
wait the return of light in order to accomplish our escape
from the ice,&mdash;with the brig if possible, if impossible,
without it,&mdash;before the frail appliances and stores which are
now left are entirely exhausted. Of course, it would be
both impolitic and unwise to apprise the crew of my
thoughts on this painful subject, so I will keep my own
counsel in the meantime. I can see, however, that I am
not alone in my convictions.</p>

<p>During November, I observed a few of my best men
getting nervous and depressed&mdash;M&rsquo;Gary paced the deck
all one Sunday in a fit of home-sickness, without eating a
meal&mdash;I do my best to cheer them; but it is hard work
to hide one&rsquo;s own trials for the sake of others who have
not as many. I am glad of my professional drill and its
companion influence over the sick and toil worn. I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span>
not get along at all unless I combined the offices of
physician and commander. You cannot punish sick
men.</p>

<p>December saw the brig fitted up for the winter; and, all
things considered, very comfortably we made it. Tom
Hickey, our good-humoured, blundering cabin-boy, decorated
since poor Schubert&rsquo;s death with the dignities of
cook, is in that little dirty cot on the starboard-side; the
rest are bedded in rows, Mr Brooks and myself choke
aft. Our bunks are close against the frozen moss-wall,
where we can take in the entire family at a glance. The
apartment measures twenty feet by eighteen; its height
six feet four inches at one place, but diversified elsewhere
by beams crossing at different distances from the floor.
The avenue by which it is approached is barely to be seen
in the moss-wall forward. The avenue&mdash;Ben-Djerback is
our poetic name for it&mdash;closes on the inside with a door
well patched with flannel, from which, stooping upon all-fours,
you back down a descent of four feet in twelve,
through a tunnel three feet high and two feet six inches
broad. It would have been a tight squeeze for a man like
Mr Brooks, when he was better fed and fatter. Arrived at
the bottom, you straighten yourself, and a second door
admits you into the dark and sorrowing hold, empty of
stores, and stripped to its naked ceiling for firewood.
From this we grope our way to the main hatch, and
mount by a rude stairway of boxes into the open air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 2.</i>&mdash;Many of the men are down with sickness
and scurvy, and this adds greatly to my anxiety. M&rsquo;Gary,
Riley, Wilson, and Brooks, are all on the sick-list, and as
for poor Morton, I am afraid I will lose him. Poor fellows,
I can ill afford to lose any of them; but if Morton dies, it
will be a great loss indeed. He is not only one of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
most intelligent men, but he is daring, cool, and every way
trustworthy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of the Wanderers</div>

<p>&ldquo;On the 7th we had an agreeable surprise. I was asleep
in the forenoon, after the fatigue of an extra night-watch,
when I was called to the deck by the report of &lsquo;Esquimaux
sledges.&rsquo; They came on rapidly, five sledges, with
teams of six dogs each, most of the drivers strangers to us;
and in a few minutes were at the brig. Their errand was
of charity: they were bringing back to us Bonsall and Petersen,
two of the party that left us on the 28th of August.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The party had many adventures and much suffering to
tell of. They had verified by painful and perilous experience
all I had anticipated for them. But the most stirring
of their announcements was the condition they had left
their associates in, two hundred miles off, divided in their
counsels, their energies broken, and their provisions nearly
gone. Space and opportunity will not permit of my giving
an account of their wanderings and privations, but they
were very severe. My first thought was of the means of
rescuing them. After a little necessary delay I despatched
a party to relieve them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the morning of the 12th Brooks awoke me with
the cry of &lsquo;Esquimaux again!&rsquo; I dressed hastily, and
groping my way over the pile of boxes that leads up from
the hold into the darkness above, made out a group of
human figures, masked by the hooded jumpers of the
natives. They stopped at the gangway, and, as I was
about to challenge, one of them sprang forward and grasped
my hand. It was Doctor Hayes. A few words, dictated
by suffering, certainly not by any anxiety as to his reception,
and at his bidding the whole party came upon deck.
Poor fellows! I could only grasp their hands and give
them a brother&rsquo;s welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">« 162 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One by one they all came in and were housed. Poor
fellows! as they threw open their Esquimaux garments by
the stove, how they relished the scanty luxuries which we
had to offer them! The coffee and the meat-biscuit soup,
and the molasses and wheat bread, even the salt pork
which our scurvy forbade the rest of us to touch,&mdash;how
they relished it all! For more than two months they had
lived on frozen seal and walrus-meat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 23.</i>&mdash;A very serious occurrence took place
to-day, which might have resulted in disastrous consequences.
A watch had been stationed in charge of the
lamp, with the usual order of &lsquo;No uncovered lights.&rsquo; He
deserted his post. Soon afterward Hans found the cooking-room
on fire. It was a horrible crisis; for no less than
eight of our party were absolutely nailed to their beds, and
there was nothing but a bulkhead between them and the
fire. I gave short but instant orders, stationing a line
between the tide-hole and the main hatch, detailing two
men to work with me, and ordering all the rest who could
move to their quarters. Dr Hayes with his maimed foot,
Mr Brooks with his contracted legs, and poor Morton,
otherwise among our best men, could do nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Brig on Fire</div>

<p>&ldquo;Before we reached the fire the entire bulkhead was in
a blaze as well as the dry timbers and skin of the brig.
Our moss walls, with their own tinder-like material and
their light casing of inflammable wood, were entirely
hidden by the flames. Fortunately the furs of the recently-returned
party were at hand, and with them I succeeded
in smothering the fire. But I was obliged to push through
the blaze of our sailcloth bulkhead in order to defend the
wall; and in my anxiety to save time, I had left the cabin
without either cap or mittens. I got through somehow or
other, and tore down the canvas which hung against that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">« 163 »</a></span>
dangerous locality. Our rifles were in this corner, and
their muzzles pointing in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water now began to pass down; but with the discharge
of the first bucketful the smoke overcame me. As
I found myself going I pushed for the hatchway, knowing
that the bucket-line would <i>feel</i> me. Seeing was impossible;
but, striking Ohlsen&rsquo;s legs as I fell, I was passed up to
the deck, <i>minus</i> beard, eyebrows, and forelock, <i>plus</i> two
burns on the forehead and one on each palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about three minutes after making way with the
canvas the fire was got under, and in less than half an hour
all was safe again. But the transition, for even the shortest
time, from the fiery Shadrachin furnace-temperature below,
to 46&deg; below zero above, was intolerably trying. Every
man suffered, and few escaped without frost-bitten fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remembrance of the danger and its horrible results
almost miraculously averted, shocks us all. Had we lost
our brig, not a man could have survived. Without shelter,
clothing, or food, what help could we have on the open ice
field?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>December 25, Christmas Day.</i>&mdash;All together again, the
returned and the steadfast, we sat down to our Christmas
dinner. There was more love than with the &lsquo;stalled ox&rsquo; of
former times; but of herbs none. We forgot our discomforts
in the blessings which adhered to us still; and when
we thought of the long road ahead of us, we thought of it
hopefully. I pledged myself to give them their next
Christmas with their homes; and each of us drank his
&lsquo;absent friends&rsquo; with ferocious zest over one-eighteenth
part of a bottle of sillery,&mdash;the last of its hamper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We entered upon the New-Year 1851 with mingled
feelings of hope and dismay. The long, dull, dreary months
of January and February &ldquo;dragged their slow length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">« 164 »</a></span>
along&rdquo; without much variety or incidents worth noting. We
devised plans by which we hoped to be able to get away
from our frozen fortress, but could do nothing in the way
of execution until the much-longed-for light re-appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>February 10.</i>&mdash;At length we have prognostications of
the return of the blessed sun. The day is beginning to
glow with its rays. The south at noon has almost an
orange tinge. In ten days his direct rays will reach our
hill tops, and in a week after he will be dispensing his
blessed medicine among our sufferers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to inflict on the reader a succession
of journal-records like these. They tell of nothing
but the varying symptoms of sick men, dreary, profitless
hunts, relieved now and then by the signalised incident of
a killed rabbit or a deer seen, and the longed-for advent of
the solar light.</p>

<p>We worked on board&mdash;those of us who could work at
all&mdash;at arranging a new gangway with a more gentle slope,
to let some of the party crawl up from their hospital into
the air. We were six, all told, out of eighteen, who could
affect to hunt, cook, or nurse.</p>

<p>For myself, my thoughts had occupation enough in the
question of our closing labours. I never lost my hope. I
looked to the coming spring as full of responsibilities; but
I had bodily strength and moral tone enough to look
through them to the end. A trust, based on experience as
well as on promises, buoyed me up at the worst of times.
Call it fatalism, as you ignorantly may, there is that in the
story of every eventful life which teaches the inefficiency
of human means and the present control of a Supreme
Agency. See how often relief has come at the moment of
extremity, in forms strangely unsought, almost at the time
unwelcome; see, still more, how the back has been strengthened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">« 165 »</a></span>
to its increasing burden, and the heart cheered by
some conscious influence of an unseen Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>February 21.</i>&mdash;To-day the crests of the north-east
headland were gilded by true sunshine, and all who were
able assembled on deck to greet it. For the past ten days
we have been watching the growing warmth of our landscape,
as it emerged from buried shadow, through all the
stages of distinctness of an India-ink washing, step by
step, into the sharp, bold definition of our desolate harbour
scene. We have marked every dash of colour which the
great Painter in his benevolence vouchsafed to us; and
now the empurpled blues, clear, unmistakable, the spreading
lake, the flickering yellow; peering at all these, poor
wretches! everything seemed superlative lustre and unsurpassable
glory. We had so grovelled in darkness that we
oversaw the light.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sickness</div>

<p>My journal for March is little else than a chronicle of
sufferings. Our little party was quite broken down.
Every man on board was tainted with scurvy, and it was
not common to find more than three who could assist in
caring for the rest. The greater number were in their
bunks, absolutely unable to stir.</p>

<p>The circumstances were well fitted to bring out the
character of individuals. Some were intensely grateful for
every little act of kindness from their more fortunate messmates;
some querulous; others desponding; others again
wanted only strength to become mutinous. Brooks, my
first officer, as stalwart a man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s man as ever faced an
enemy, burst into tears when he first saw himself in the
glass. On Sunday, the 4th, our last remnant of fresh
meat had been doled out. Our invalids began to sink
rapidly. The region about our harbour ceased to furnish
its scanty contingent of game. One of our huntsmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
Petersen, never very reliable in anything, declared himself
unfit for further duty. Hans was unsuccessful: he made
several wide circuits, and saw deer twice; but once they
were beyond range, and the next time his rifle missed fire.</p>

<p>I tried the hunt for a long morning myself, without
meeting a single thing of life, and was convinced, by the
appearance of things on my return to the brig, that I
should peril the morale, and with it the only hope, of my
command by repeating the experiment.</p>

<p>I laboured, of course, with all the ingenuity of a well-taxed
mind, to keep up the spirits of my comrades. I
cooked for them all imaginable compounds of our unvaried
diet-list, and brewed up flax-seed and lime-juice and quinine
and willow-stems into an abomination which was dignified
as beer, and which some were persuaded for the time to
believe such. But it was becoming more and more certain
every hour, that unless we could renew our supplies of
fresh meat, the days of the party were numbered.</p>

<p>I spare myself, as well as the readers of this hastily-compiled
volume, when I pass summarily over the details
of our condition at this time.</p>

<p>I look back at it with recollections like those of a nightmare.
Yet I was borne up wonderfully. I never doubted
for an instant that the same Providence which had guarded
us through the long darkness of winter was still watching
over us for good, and that it was yet in reserve for us&mdash;for
some, I dared not hope for all&mdash;to bear back the tidings of
our rescue to a Christian land. But how I did not see.</p>

<p>The advent of April brings with it a better state of
matters. Petersen has so far recovered that he is able to
go hunting, and he has met with some success; and never
was blessing more welcome than the fresh meat with which
his gun supplied our long starved table. Several of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span>
crew are on their legs again, and things generally begin to
assume a healthier aspect. Business, as far as our shattered
constitutions will permit, is now the order of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 20.</i>&mdash;A relief-watch, of Riley, Morton, and
Bonsall, are preparing to saw out sledge runners from the
cross-beams of the brig. It is slow work. They are very
weak, and the thermometer sinks at night to -26&deg;.
Nearly all our beams have been used up for fuel; but I
have saved enough to construct two sledges. I want a
sledge sufficiently long to bring the weight of the whale-boat
and her stowage within the line of the runner; this
will prevent her rocking and pitching when crossing hummocked
ice, and enable us to cradle her firmly to the sledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All at Work</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 21.</i>&mdash;Morton&rsquo;s heel is nearly closed, and there is
apparently a sound bone underneath. He has been upon
his back since October. I can now set this faithful and
valuable man to active duty very soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beam was too long to be carried through our
hatches; we therefore have sawed it as it stands, and will
carry up the slabs separately. These slabs are but one and
a half inch wide, and must be strengthened by iron bolts
and cross-pieces; still they are all that we have. I made
the bolts out of our cabin curtain-rods, long disused. Mr
Petersen aids Ohlsen in grinding his tools. They will
complete the job to-morrow,&mdash;for we must work on Sunday
now,&mdash;and by Monday be able to begin at other things.
Petersen undertakes to manufacture our cooking and mess-gear.
I have a sad-looking assortment of battered rusty tins
to offer him; but with the stove-pipe much may be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 22.</i>&mdash;Gave rest for all but the sawyers, who keep
manfully at the beam. Some notion of our weakness may
be formed from the fact of these five poor follows averaging
among them but one foot per hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption3">PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING THE BRIG.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">We</span> continued toiling on with our complicated preparations
till the evening of the 24th, when Hans came back well
laden with walrus meat. Three of the Esquimaux accompanied
him, each with his sledge and dog-team fully
equipped for a hunt. The leader of the party, Kalutunah,
was a noble savage, greatly superior in everything to the
others of his race. He greeted me with respectful courtesy,
yet as one who might rightfully expect an equal measure
of it in return, and, after a short interchange of salutations,
seated himself in the post of honour at my side.</p>

<p>I waited, of course, till the company had fed and slept,
for among savages especially haste is indecorous, and then,
after distributing a few presents, opened to them my project
of a northern exploration. Kalutunah received his
knife and needles with a &ldquo;Kuyanake,&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank you:&rdquo;
the first thanks I have heard from a native of this upper
region. He called me his friend,&mdash;&ldquo;Asakaoteet,&rdquo; &ldquo;I love
you well,&rdquo;&mdash;and would be happy, he said, to join the
&ldquo;nalegak-soak&rdquo; in a hunt.</p>

<p>The project was one that had engaged my thoughts long
before daylight had renewed the possibility of carrying it
out. I felt that the further shores beyond Kennedy
Channel were still to be searched before our work could be
considered finished; but we were without dogs, the indispensable
means of travel. We had only four left out of
sixty-two. Famine among the Esquimaux had been as
disastrous as disease with us: they had killed all but thirty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span>
and of these there were now sixteen picketed on the ice
about the brig. The aid and influence of Kalutunah could
secure my closing expedition.</p>

<p>I succeeded in making my arrangements with him, provisionally
at least, and the morning after we all set out.
The party consisted of Kalutunah, Shang-hu, and Tatterat,
an outlandish Esquimaux, who had his name from the
Kitty-wake Gull, with their three sledges. Hans, armed
with the Marston rifle, was my only companion from the
ship&rsquo;s company. The natives carried no arms but the long
knife and their unicorn ivory lances. Our whole equipment
was by no means cumbersome: except the clothes
upon our back and raw walrus-meat, we carried nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting Out</div>

<p>We started with a wild yell of dogs and men in chorus,
Kalutunah and myself leading. In about two hours we
had reached a high berg about fifteen miles north of the
brig. Here I reconnoitred the ice ahead. It was not
cheering: the outside tide-channel, where I had broken
through the fall before, was now full of squeezed ice, and
the plain beyond the bergs seem much distorted. The
Esquimaux, nevertheless, acceded to my wish to attempt
the passage, and we were soon among the hummocks. We
ran beside our sledges, clinging to the upstanders, but
making, perhaps, four miles an hour where, unassisted by
the dogs, we could certainly have made but one. Things
began to look more auspicious.</p>

<p>We halted for lunch about thirty miles north of the
brig, after having edged along the coast about thirty miles
eastward. Lunch over, the journey began again,
and we should have accomplished my wishes had it not
been for the untoward influence of sundry bears. The
tracks of these animals were becoming more and more
numerous as we rounded one iceberg after another; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">« 170 »</a></span>
we could see the beds they had worn in the snow while
watching for seal. These swayed the dogs from their
course: yet we kept edging onwards; and when in sight
of the northern coast, about thirty miles from the central
peak of the &ldquo;Three Brothers,&rdquo; I saw a deep band of
stratus lying over the horizon in the direction of Kennedy
Channel. This water-sky indicated the continued opening
of the channel, and made me more deeply anxious to
proceed. But at this moment our dogs encountered a
large male bear in the act of devouring a seal. The
impulse was irresistible; I lost all control over both dogs
and drivers. They seemed dead to everything but the
passion of pursuit. Off they sped with incredible swiftness,
the Esquimaux clinging to their sledges, and cheering
their dogs with loud cries of &ldquo;Nannook!&rdquo; A mad, wild
chase, wilder than German legend,&mdash;the dogs, wolves;
the drivers, devils. After a furious run, the animal was
brought to bay; the lance and the rifle did their work,
and we halted for a general feed. The dogs gorged
themselves, the drivers did as much, and we buried the
remainder of the carcass in the snow. A second bear had
been tracked by the party to a large iceberg north of Cape
Russel; for we had now travelled to the neighbourhood of
the Great Glacier. But the dogs were too much distended
by their abundant diet to move: their drivers were scarcely
better. Rest was indispensable.</p>

<p>We took a four hours&rsquo; sleep on the open ice, the most
uncomfortable that I remember. Our fatigue had made
us dispense with the snow-house; and, though I was
heavily clad in a full suit of furs, and squeezed myself in
between Kalutunah and Shang-hu, I could not bear the
intense temperature. I rose in the morning stiff and sore.
I mention it as a trait of nobleness on the part of Kalutunah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
which I appreciated very sensibly at the time, that, seeing
me suffer, he took his kapetah from his back and placed it
around my feet.</p>

<p>The next day I tried again to make my friends steer to
the northward. But the bears were most numerous upon
the Greenland side; and they determined to push on
toward the glacier. They were sure, they said, of finding
the game among the broken icebergs at the base of it.
All my remonstrances and urgent entreaties were unavailing
to make them resume their promised route. They said
that to cross so high up as we then were was impossible,
and I felt the truth of this when I remembered the fate of
poor Baker and Schubert at this very passage. Kalutunah
added, significantly, that the bear-meat was absolutely
necessary for the support of their families, and that
Nalegak had no right to prevent him from providing for
his household. It was a strong argument, and withal the
argument of the strong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bear Hunting</div>

<p>I found now that my projected survey of the northern
coast must be abandoned, at least for the time. My next
wish was to get back to the brig, and to negotiate with
Metek for a purchase or loan of his dogs as my last
chance. But even this was not readily gratified. All
of Saturday was spent in bear-hunting. The natives, as
indomitable as their dogs, made the entire circuit of Dallas
Bay, and finally halted again under one of the islands
which group themselves between the headlands of Advance
Bay and at the base of the glacier.</p>

<p>While the Esquimaux were hunting about the bergs, I
sat and took a sketch of the glacier; seeing them come to
a halt above the island, I gained the nearest sledge, and
the whole party gathered together a few miles from the
face of the glacier. Here Hans and myself crawled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>
Tatterat and his dogs into an impromptu snow-hut, and,
cheered by our aggregated warmth, slept comfortably.
Our little dome, or rather burrow, for it was scooped out
of a drift, fell down in the night; but we were so worn
out that it did not wake us.</p>

<p>On rising from a sleep in the open air, at a temperature
of 12&deg; below zero, the hunt was resumed along the face of
the glacier, with just enough of success to wear out the
dogs and endanger my chances of return to the brig. In
spite of the grandeur of the scenery and the noble displays
of force exhibited by the falling bergs, my thoughts
wandered back to the party I had left; and I was really
glad when Kalutunah yielded to my renewed persuasion,
and turned his team toward the ice-belt of the south-eastern
shore.</p>

<p>The spot at which we landed I have called Cape James
Kent. It was a lofty headland, and the land-ice which
hugged its base was covered with rocks from the cliffs
above. As I looked over this ice-belt, losing itself in the
far distance, and covered with its millions of tons of
rubbish, greenstones, limestones, chlorite slates, rounded
and angular, massive and ground to powder, its importance
as a geological agent in the transportation of drift struck
me with great force. Its whole substance was studded
with these varied contributions from the shore; and
further to the south, upon the now frozen waters of
Marshall Bay, I could recognise raft after raft from the
last year&rsquo;s ice-belt, which had been caught by the winter,
each one laden with its heavy freight of foreign material.</p>

<p>On the south-eastern corner of this bay, where some
low islands at the mouth of the fiord formed a sort of protection
against the north wind, was a group of Esquimaux
remains,&mdash;huts, cairns, and graves. Though evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span>
long deserted, my drivers seemed to know all about
them, for they suspended the hunt around the bergs to
take a look at these evidences of a bygone generation of
their fathers.</p>

<p>There were five huts, with two stone pedestals for the
protection of meat, and one of those strange little kennels
which serve as dormitories when the igloë is crowded. The
graves were further up the fiord; from them I obtained a
knife of bone, but no indications of iron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;The Inhabited Spot&rdquo;</div>

<p>These huts stood high up, upon a set of shingle terraces,
similar to those of Rensselaer Bay. The belt-ice at their
foot was old and undisturbed, and must have been so for
years; so, too, was the heavy ice of the bay. Yet around
these old homesteads were bones of the seal and walrus,
and the vertebræ of a whale similar to that of the igloë of
Anoatok. There must have been both open water and a
hunting-ground around them, and the huts had in former
days been close upon this water-line. &ldquo;Una suna nuna?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What land is this, Kalutunah?&rdquo; I did not understand
his answer, which was long and emphatic; but I found
from our interpreter that the place was still called &ldquo;the
inhabited spot;&rdquo; and that a story was well preserved
among them of a time when families were sustained beside
its open water, and musk-ox inhabited the hills. We
followed the belt-ice, crossing only at the headlands of
the bays, and arrived at the brig on the afternoon of
Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux left the brig after a day&rsquo;s rest, fully
laden with wood and other presents, and promising to
engage Metek, if they could, to come up with his four
dogs. They themselves engaged to lend me one dog from
each of their teams. It pleased me to find that I had
earned character with these people, at first so suspicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span>
and distrustful. They left on board each man his dog,
without a shade of doubt as to my good faith, only begging
me to watch the poor animals&rsquo; feet, as the famine
had nearly exterminated their stock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The month of May had come. Metek, less confiding
because less trustworthy than Kalutunah, did not bring his
dogs, and my own exhausted team was in almost daily
requisition to bring in supplies of food from Etah. Everything
admonished me that the time was at hand when we
must leave the brig and trust our fortunes to the floes.
Our preparations were well advanced, and the crew so far
restored to health that all but three or four could take
some part in completing them.</p>

<p>Still, I could not allow myself to pass away from our
region of search without a last effort to visit the furthest
shores of the channel. Our communications with the
Esquimaux, and some successful hunts of our own, had
given us a stock of provisions for at least a week in
advance. I conferred with my officers, made a full distribution
of the work to be performed in my absence, and set
out once more, with Morton for my only companion. We
took with us the light sledge, adding the two borrowed
dogs to our team, but travelling ourselves on foot. Our
course was to be by the middle ice, and our hope that we
might find it free enough from hummocks to permit us to
pass.</p>

<p>My journal, written after our return, gives nothing but a
series of observations going to verify and complete my
charts. We struggled manfully, through days and nights
of adventurous exposure and recurring disaster, to force
our way, and at last found our way back to the brig,
Morton broken down anew, and my own energies just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">« 175 »</a></span>
adequate to the duty of supervising our final departure. I
had neither time nor strength to expend on my diary.</p>

<p>The operations of the search were closed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparing for Retreat</div>

<p>The detailed preparations for our escape would have
little interest for the general reader; but they were so
arduous and so important that I cannot pass them by without
a special notice. They had been begun from an early
day of the fall, and had not been entirely intermitted
during our severest winter-trials. All who could work,
even at picking over eider-down, found every moment of
leisure fully appropriated. But since our party had begun
to develop the stimulus of more liberal diet, our labours
were more systematic and diversified.</p>

<p>The manufacture of clothing had made considerable progress.
Canvas mocassins had been made for every one of
the party, and three dozen were added as a common stock
to meet emergencies. Three pairs of boots were allowed
each man. These were generally of carpeting, with soles
of walrus and seal hide; and when the supply of these was
exhausted, the leather from the chaffing-gear of the brig for
a time supplied their place. A much better substitute was
found afterward in the gutta-percha that had formed the
speaking-tube. This was softened by warm water, cut into
Lengths, and so made available to its new uses. Blankets
were served out as the material for body clothing. Every
man was his own tailor.</p>

<p>For bedding, the woollen curtains that had formerly
decorated our berths supplied us with a couple of large
coverlets, which were abundantly quilted with eider-down.
Two buffalo-robes of the same size, with the coverlets, were
arranged so as to button on them, forming sleeping-sacks
for the occasion, but easily detached for the purpose of
drying or airing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span></p>

<p>Our provision-bags were of assorted sizes, to fit under
the thwarts of the boats. They were of sailcloth, made
water-tight by tar and pitch, which we kept from penetrating
the canvas by first coating it with flour-paste and
plaster of Paris. The bread-bags were double, the inner
saturated with paste and plaster by boiling in the mixture,
and the space between the two filled with pitch. Every
bag was, in sailor-phrase, roped and becketed; in ordinary
parlance, well secured by cordage.</p>

<p>These different manufactures had all of them been
going on through the winter, and more rapidly as the
spring advanced. They had given employment to the
thoughts of our sick men, and in this way had exerted a
wholesome influence on their moral tone and assisted their
convalescence. Other preparations had been begun more
recently. The provisions for the descent were to be got
ready and packed. The ship-bread was powdered by
beating it with a capstan-bar, and pressed down into the
bags which were to carry it. Pork-fat and tallow were
melted down, and poured into other bags to freeze. A
stock of concentrated bean-soup was cooked, and secured
for carriage like the pork-fat; and the flour and remaining
meat-biscuit were to be protected from moisture in double
bags. These were the only provisions we were to carry
with us. I knew I should be able to subsist the
party for some time after their setting out by the
food I could bring from the vessel by occasional trips
with my dog-team. For the rest we relied upon our
guns.</p>

<p>Besides all this, we had our camp equipage to get in
order, and the vitally important organization of our system
of boats and sledges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Boats</div>

<p>Our boats were three in number, all of them well battered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">« 177 »</a></span>
by exposure to ice and storm, almost as destructive
of their sea-worthiness as the hot sun of other regions.
Two of them were cypress whale-boats, twenty-six feet long,
with seven feet beam, and three feet deep. These were
strengthened with oak bottom-pieces and a long string-piece
bolted to the keel. A wash board of light cedar,
about six inches high, served to strengthen the gunwale
and give increased depth. A neat housing of light canvas
was stretched upon a ridge-line sustained fore and aft by
stanchions, and hung down over the boats&rsquo; sides, where it
was fastened (stopped) to a jack-stay. My last year&rsquo;s
experience on the attempt to reach Beechy Island determined
me to carry but one mast to each boat. It was
stepped into an oaken thwart, made especially strong, as it
was expected to carry sail over ice as well as water; the
mast could be readily unshipped, and carried, with the
oars, boat-hooks, and ice-poles, alongside the boat. The
third boat was my little <i>Red Eric</i>. We mounted her
on the old sledge, the <i>Faith</i>, hardly relying on her for
any purposes of navigation, but with the intention of cutting
her up for firewood in case our guns should fail to
give us a supply of blubber.</p>

<p>Indeed, in spite of all the ingenuity of our carpenter,
Mr Ohlsen, well seconded by the persevering labours of
M&rsquo;Gary and Bonsall, not one of our boats was positively
sea-worthy. The <i>Hope</i> would not pass even charitable
inspection, and we expected to burn her on reaching water.
The planking of all of them was so dried it could hardly
be made tight by calking.</p>

<p>The three boats were mounted on sledges rigged with
rue-raddies; the provisions stowed snugly under the thwarts;
the chronometers carefully boxed and padded, placed in the
stern-sheets of the <i>Hope</i>, in charge of Mr Sontag. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">« 178 »</a></span>
them were such of the instruments as we could venture to
transport.</p>

<p>Our powder and shot, upon which our lives depended,
were carefully distributed in bags and tin canisters. The
percussion-caps I took into my own possession, as more
precious than gold. Mr Bonsall had a general charge of
the arms and ammunition. Places were arranged for the
guns, and hunters appointed for each boat. Mr Petersen
took charge of the most important part of our field-equipage,
our cooking gear. Petersen was our best tinker. All
the old stove-pipe, now none the better for two winters of
Arctic fires, was called into requisition. Each boat was
provided with two large iron cylinders, fourteen inches in
diameter and eighteen high. Each of them held an iron
saucer or lamp, in which we could place our melted pork-fat
or blubber, and, with the aid of spun-yarn for a wick,
make a roaring fire. I need not say that the fat and oil
always froze when not ignited.</p>

<p>Into these cylinders, which were used merely to defend
our lamp from the wind, and our pots from contact with
the cold air, we placed a couple of large tin vessels, suitable
either for melting snow or making tea or soup. They were
made out of cake-canisters cut down. How many kindly
festival associations hung by these now abused soup-cans!
One of them had, before the fire rubbed off its bright gilding,
the wedding inscription of a large fruit-cake.</p>

<p>We carried spare tins in case the others should burn
out; it was well we did so. So completely had we
exhausted our household furniture, that we had neither
cups nor plates, except crockery. This, of course, would
not stand the travel, and our spare tin had to be saved for
protecting the boats from ice. At this juncture we cut
plates out of every imaginable and rejected piece of tin-ware.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">« 179 »</a></span>
Borden&rsquo;s meat-biscuit canisters furnished us with
a splendid dinner-service; and some rightly-feared tin
jars, with ominous labels of Corrosive Sublimate and
Arsenic, which once belonged to our department of natural
history, were emptied, scoured, and cut down into tea-cups.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final Orders</div>

<p>Recognising the importance of acting directly upon the
men&rsquo;s minds, my first step now was to issue a general
order appointing a certain day, the 17th of May, for setting
out. Every man had twenty-four hours given him to
select and get ready his eight pounds of personal effects.
After that, his time was to cease to be his own for any
purpose. The long-indulged waywardness of our convalescents
made them take this hardly. Some who were at
work on articles of apparel that were really important to
them threw them down unfinished, in a sick man&rsquo;s pet. I
had these in some cases picked up quietly and finished by
others. But I showed myself inexorable. It was necessary
to brace up and concentrate every man&rsquo;s thoughts and
energies upon the one great common object, our departure
from the vessel on the 17th, not to return.</p>

<p>I tried my best also to fix and diffuse impressions that
we were going home. But in this I was not always successful.
I was displeased, indeed, with the moody indifference
with which many went about the tasks to which I
put them. The completeness of my preparations I know
had its influence; but there were many doubters. Some
were convinced that my only object was to move further
south, retaining the brig, however, as a home to retreat to.
Others whispered that I wanted to transport the sick to the
hunting grounds and other resources of the lower settlements.
A few of a more cheerful spirit thought I had
resolved to make for some point of look-out, in the hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">« 180 »</a></span>
a rescue by whalers or English expedition parties which
were supposed still to be within the Arctic circle. The
number is unfortunately small of those human beings
whom calamity elevates.</p>

<p>There was no sign or affectation of spirit or enthusiasm
upon the memorable day when we first adjusted the boats
to their cradles on the sledges and moved them off to the
ice-foot. But the ice immediately around the vessel was
smooth; and, as the boats had not received their lading,
the first labour was an easy one. As the runners moved,
the gloom of several countenances were perceptibly lightened.
The croakers had protested that we could not stir an
inch. These cheering remarks always reach a commander&rsquo;s
ears, and I took good care of course to make the outset
contradict them. By the time we reached the end of our
little level, the tone had improved wonderfully, and we
were prepared for the effort of crossing the successive lines
of the belt-ice and forcing a way through the smashed
material which interposed between us and the ice-foot.</p>

<p>This was a work of great difficulty, and sorrowfully
exhausting to the poor fellows not yet accustomed to heave
together. But in the end I had the satisfaction, before
twenty-four hours were over, of seeing our little arks of
safety hauled upon the higher plane of the ice-foot, in full
trim for ornamental exhibition from the brig; their neat
canvas-housing rigged, tent-fashion, over the entire length
of each; a jaunty little flag, made out of one of the commander&rsquo;s
obsolete linen shirts, decorated in stripes from a
disused article of stationery, the red-ink bottle, and with a
very little of the blue-bag in the star-spangled corner. All
hands after this returned on board; I had ready for them
the best supper our supplies afforded, and they turned in
with minds prepared for their departure next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">« 181 »</a></span></p>

<p>They were nearly all of them invalids, unused to open
air and exercise. It was necessary to train them very gradually.
We made but two miles the first day, and with a
single boat; and indeed for some time after this I took
care that they should not be disheartened by overwork.
They came back early to a hearty supper and warm beds,
and I had the satisfaction of marching them back each
recurring morning refreshed and cheerful. The weather,
happily, was superb.</p>

<p class="caption3">FAREWELL TO THE &ldquo;ADVANCE.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Our</span> last farewell to the brig was made with more
solemnity. The entire ship&rsquo;s company was collected in
our dismantled winter-chamber to take part in the ceremonial.
It was Sunday. Our moss walls had been torn
down, and the wood that supported them burned. Our
beds were off at the boats. The galley was unfurnished
and cold. Everything about the little den of refuge was
desolate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leaving the &ldquo;Advance&rdquo;</div>

<p>We read prayers and a chapter of the Bible; and then,
all standing silently round, I took Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s
portrait from its frame and cased it in an India-rubber
scroll. I next read the reports of inspection and survey
which had been made by the several commissions organized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">« 182 »</a></span>
for the purpose, all of them testifying to the necessities
under which I was about to act. I then addressed the
party: I did not affect to disguise the difficulties that
were before us; but I assured them that they could all be
overcome by energy and subordination to command; and
that the thirteen hundred miles of ice and water that lay
between us and North Greenland could be traversed with
safety for most of us, and hope for all. I added, that as
men and messmates, it was the duty of us all, enjoined by
gallantry as well as religion, to postpone every consideration
of self to the protection of the wounded and sick; and
that this must be regarded by every man, and under
all circumstances, as a paramount order. In conclusion, I
told them to think over the trials we had all of us gone
through, and to remember each man for himself how
often an unseen Power had rescued him in peril; and I
admonished them still to place reliance on Him who could
not change.</p>

<p>I was met with a right spirit. After a short conference,
an engagement was drawn up by one of the officers, and
brought to me with the signatures of all the company,
without an exception. It read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdr2">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Second Grinnell Expedition</span>,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brig</span> &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Advance</span>,&rsquo; <i>May</i> 20, 1855.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;The undersigned, being convinced of the impossibility
of the liberation of the brig, and equally convinced of the
impossibility of remaining in the ice a third winter, do
fervently concur with the commander in his attempt to
reach the south by means of boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the trials and hardships which are before us,
and feeling the necessity of union, harmony, and discipline,
we have determined to abide faithfully by the expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">« 183 »</a></span>
and our sick comrades, and to do all that we can, as true
men, to advance the objects in view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Memorial</div>

<p>I had prepared a brief memorial of the considerations
which justified our abandonment of the vessel, and had
read it as part of my address. I now fixed it to a
stanchion near the gangway, where it must attract the
notice of any who might seek us hereafter, and stand with
them as my vindication for the step, in case we should be
overtaken by disaster. It closed with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regard the abandonment of the brig as inevitable.
We have by actual inspection but thirty-six days&rsquo; provisions,
and a careful survey shows that we cannot cut
more firewood without rendering our craft unseaworthy.
A third winter would force us, as the only means of
escaping starvation, to resort to Esquimaux habits and
give up all hope of remaining by the vessel and her
resources. It would therefore in no manner advance the
search after Sir John Franklin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under any circumstances, to remain longer would be
destructive to those of our little party who have already
suffered from the extreme severity of the climate and its
tendencies to disease. Scurvy has enfeebled more or less
every man in the expedition; and an anomalous spasmodic
disorder, allied to tetanus, has cost us the life of two of
our most prized comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, speaking on the part of my companions and
myself, that we have done all that we ought to do
to prove our tenacity of purpose and devotion to the
cause which we have undertaken. This attempt to escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">« 184 »</a></span>
by crossing the southern ice on sledges is regarded by
me as an imperative duty,&mdash;the only means of saving
ourselves and preserving the laboriously-earned results of
the expedition.</p>

<p class="tdr">

<p>We then went upon deck: the flags were hoisted and
hauled down again, and our party walked once or twice
around the brig, looking at her timbers and exchanging
comments upon the scars which reminded them of every
stage of her dismantling. Our figure-head&mdash;the fair
Augusta, the little blue girl with pink cheeks, who had
lost her breast by an iceberg and her nose by a nip off
Bedevilled Reach&mdash;was taken from our bows and placed
aboard the &ldquo;Hope.&rdquo; &ldquo;She is at any rate wood,&rdquo; said the
men, when I hesitated about giving them the additional
burden; &ldquo;and if we cannot carry her far we can burn her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one thought of the mockery of cheers: we had no
festival-liquor to mislead our perception of the real state of
things. When all hands were quite ready, we scrambled
off over the ice together, much like a gang of stevedores
going to work over a quayful of broken cargo.</p>

<p>Excluding four sick men, who were unable to move,
and myself, who had to drive the dog-team and serve as
common carrier and courier, we numbered but twelve men,&mdash;which
would have given six to a sledge, or too few to
move it. It was therefore necessary to concentrate our
entire force upon one sledge at a time. On the other hand,
however, it was important to the efficiency of our organization
that matters of cooking, sleeping baggage, and rations,
should be regulated by separate messes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">« 185 »</a></span></p>

<p>The routine I established was the most precise:&mdash;Daily
prayers both morning and evening, all hands gathering
round in a circle and standing uncovered during the short
exercise; regulated hours; fixed duties and positions at
the track-lines and on the halt; the cooking to be taken
by turns, the captains of the boats alone being excused.
The charge of the log was confided to Dr Hayes, and the
running survey to Mr Sontag. Though little could be
expected from either of these gentlemen at this time, I
deemed it best to keep up the appearance of ordinary
voyaging; and after we left the first ices of Smith&rsquo;s Straits
I was indebted to them for valuable results. The thermometer
was observed every three hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Boats&rsquo; Crews</div>

<p>To my faithful friend and first officer, boatswain Brooks,
I assigned the command of the boats and sledges. I knew
how well he was fitted for it; and when forced, as I was
afterward during the descent, to be in constant motion
between the sick-station, the Esquimaux settlements, and
the deserted brig, I felt safe in the assurance of his tried
fidelity and indomitable resolution. The party under him
was marshalled at the rue-raddies as a single gang; but
the messes were arranged with reference to the two whale-boats,
and when we came afterward to the open water the
crews distributed in the same way:&mdash;</p>

<p>With this organization we set out on our march.</p>

<p>Up to the evening of the 23d, the progress was little
more than a mile a day for one sledge; on the 24th, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">« 186 »</a></span>
sledges reached First Ravine, a distance of seven miles, when
we found that the dog-sledge had brought on to this station
the buffalo bags and other sleeping appliances which
we had prepared during the winter. The condition of the
party was such that it was essential they should sleep in
comfort; and it was a rule, therefore, during the whole
journey, never departed from unless in extreme emergency,
never to begin a new day&rsquo;s labour till the party was
refreshed from the exertions of the day before. Our halts
were regulated by the condition of the men rather than by
arbitrary hours, and sleep was meted out in proportion to
the trials of the march. We slept by day when the sun
was warmest, and travelled when we could avoid his
greatest glare.</p>

<p>Mr Morton, Ohlsen, and Petersen, during this time
performed a double duty. They took their turn at the
sledges with the rest, but they were also engaged in
preparing the <i>Red Eric</i> as a comrade boat. She was
mounted on our good old sledge, the <i>Faith</i>&mdash;a sledge
that, like her namesake, our most reliable whale-boat, had
been our very present help in many times of trouble. I
believe every man felt, when he saw her brought out,
that stout work was to be done, and under auspices of
good.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had carried Mr Goodfellow, with my
dog-sledge, to a sick-station, which I had arranged at
Anoatok; and had managed to convey the rest one by
one to the same spot. Mr Wilson, whose stump was still
unhealed, and who suffered besides from scurvy; George
Whipple, whose tendons were so contracted that he could
not extend his legs, and poor Stephenson, just able to keep
the lamps burning and warm up food for the rest, were the
other invalids, all incapable of moving without assistance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">« 187 »</a></span>
It is just that I should speak of the manly fortitude with
which they bore up during this painful imprisonment.
Dr Hayes, though still disabled from his frozen foot,
adhered manfully to the sledges.</p>

<p>As I review my notes of the first few days of our ice-journey,
I find them full of incidents, interesting and even
momentous when they occurred, but which cannot claim a
place in this narrative. The sledges were advancing
slowly, the men often discouraged, and now and then one
giving way under the unaccustomed labour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Red Boat&rdquo;</div>

<p>The <i>Red Boat</i> was completed for service in a few days,
and joined the sledge-party on the floes,&mdash;an additional
burden, but a necessary one, for our weary rue-raddies;
and I set out for the sick-station with Mr Goodfellow, our
last remaining invalid. As my team reached the entrance
of Force Bay, I saw that poor Nessark, the Esquimaux,
who had carried Mr Wilson and some stores to Anoatok,
finding his sledge-load too heavy, had thrown out a portion
of it upon the ice. He had naturally enough selected the
bread for his jettison, an article of diet unknown among
the Esquimaux, but precisely that of which our sick were
most in need. I lost some time in collecting such parts of
his rejected cargo as I could find, and, when I reached the
huts after a twelve hours&rsquo; drive, the condition of our sick
men made it imperative that I should return at once to the
brig. The strength of the dogs began to fail while crossing
the reach of Force Bay, and I was forced to camp out with
them on the ice-belt, but early in the morning I came upon
the fires of the sledge-party.</p>

<p>The men were at prayers when I first saw them; but,
as they passed to the drag-ropes, I was pained to see how
wearily they moved. Poor Brooks&rsquo; legs were so swollen
that he could not brace them in his blanket coverings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">« 188 »</a></span>
Dr Hayes could hardly keep his place. The men generally
showed symptoms of increasing scurvy. It was plain
that they could not hold their own without an increased
allowance, if not of meat, at least of fresh bread and
hot tea.</p>

<p>Taking with me Morton, my faithful adjutant always, I
hurried on to the brig.</p>

<p>We lighted fires in the galley, melted pork, baked a large
batch of bread, gathered together a quantity of beans and
dried apples, somewhat damaged, but still eatable, and by
the time our dogs had fed and rested, we were ready
for the return. Distributing our supplies as we passed
the squads on the floe, I hastened to Anoatok. I had
taken Godfrey with us from his party, and, as it was
painfully evident that the men could not continue to work
without more generous food, I sent him on to Etah with
the dogs, in the hope of procuring a stock of walrus-meat.</p>

<p>The little company at the hut welcomed my return.
They had exhausted their provisions; their lamp had gone
out; the snow-drift had forced its way in at the door, so
that they could not close it; it was blowing a north-easter;
and the thermometer, which hung against the blanketed
walls, stood only sixteen degree above zero. The poor fellows
had all the will to protect themselves, but they were lame,
and weak, and hungry, and disheartened. We built a fire
for them of tarred rope, dried their bedding, cooked them
a porridge of meat-biscuit and pea-soup, fastened up their
desolate doorway, hung a dripping-slab of pork-fat over
their lamp-wick, and, first joining in a prayer of thankfulness,
and then a round of merry gossip, all hands forgot
sickness, and privation, and distance in the contentment of
our sleeping-bags. I cannot tell how long we slept, for all
our watches ran down before we awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">« 189 »</a></span></p>

<p>The gale had risen, and it was snowing hard when I
replenished the fires of our heartstone. But we went on
burning rope and fat, in a regular tea-drinking frolic, till
not an icicle or even a frost-mark was to be seen on the
roof. After a time Godfrey rejoined us; Metek came
with him; and between their two sledges they brought an
ample supply of meat. With part of this I hastened to
the sledge-party. They were now off Ten-mile Ravine,
struggling through the accumulated snows, and much
exhausted, though not out of heart. In spite of their
swollen feet, they had worked fourteen hours a day,
passing in that time over some twelve miles of surface, and
advancing a mile and a half on their way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sledge-Party</div>

<p>Once more leaving the party on the floe, Morton and
myself, with Metek and his sledge in company, revisited
the brig, and set ourselves to work baking bread. The
brig was dreary enough, and Metek was glad to bid it
good-bye, with one hundred and fifty pounds on his dog-sledge,
consigned to Mr Brooks. But he carried besides a
letter, safely trusted to his inspection, which directed that
he should be sent back forthwith for another load. It was
something like a breach of faith, perhaps; but his services
were indispensable, and his dogs still more so. He
returned, of course, for there was no escaping us; his
village lay in the opposite direction, and he could not
deviate from the track after once setting out. In the
time we had cooked about a hundred pounds of flour
pudding, and tried out a couple of bagfuls of pork-fat,&mdash;a
good days work,&mdash;and we were quite ready, before the
subdued brightness of midnight came, to turn in to our
beds. Our beds!&mdash;there was not an article of covering
left on board. We ripped open the old mattresses, and, all
three crawling down among the curled hair, Morton, Metek,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">« 190 »</a></span>
and the Nalegak, slept as sound as vagrants on a haystack.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 28th, we all set out for the boats
and Anoatok. Both Metek and myself had all our sledges
heavily laden. We carried the last of our provision-bags,
completing now our full complement of fifteen hundred
pounds, the limit of capacity of our otherwise crowded
boats.</p>

<p>It caused me a bitter pang to abandon our collection
of objects of natural history, the cherished fruit of so
much exposure and toil; and it was hardly easier to leave
some other things behind,&mdash;several of my well-tested
instruments, for instance, and those silent friends, my books.
They had all been packed up, hoping for a chance of saving
them; and, to the credit of my comrades, let me say gratefully
that they offered to exclude both clothes and food in
favour of a full freight of these treasures.</p>

<p>But the thing was not to be thought of. I gave a
last look at the desolate galley-stove, the representative
of our long winter&rsquo;s fireside, at the still bright coppers
now full of frozen water, the theodolite, the chart-box,
and poor Wilson&rsquo;s guitar,&mdash;one more at the remnant
of the old moss-walls, the useless daguerreotypes, and
the skeletons of dog, and deer, and bear, and musk-ox,&mdash;stoppered
in the rigging;&mdash;and, that done, whipped up
my dogs so much after the manner of a sentimentalising
Christian, that our pagan Metek raised a prayer in their
behalf.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE MARCH AND ITS INCIDENTS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">I found</span> that Mr Brooks had succeeded in getting his boat
and sledges as far as the floe off Bedevilled Reach. I
stopped only long enough to point out to him an outside
track, where I had found the ice quite smooth and free
from snow, and pressed my dogs for the hut. I noticed,
to my great joy, too, that the health of his party seemed
to be improving under our raw-meat specific, and could not
find fault with the extravagant use they were making of it.</p>

<p>The invalids at the sick-station were not as well as I
could have wished; but I had only time to renew their
stock of provision and give them a few cheering words.
Our walrus-meat was nearly exhausted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting Out</div>

<p>I had fixed upon two new stations further to the south,
as the depôts to which our stores were now to be transported.
One was upon the old and heavy floes off Navialik,
&ldquo;the big gull&rsquo;s place,&rdquo;&mdash;a headland opposite Cape Hatherton,&mdash;the
other on the level ice-plain near Littleton Island.
Having now gathered our stores at Anoatok, I began with
a thankful heart to move them onward. I sent on Metek
to the further station with two bags of bread-dust, each
weighing ninety pounds, and, having myself secured some
three hundred pounds at Navialik, drove on for Etah Bay.</p>

<p>My long succession of journeys on this route had made
me thoroughly weary of the endless waste of ice to seaward,
and I foolishly sought upon this trip to vary the travel by
following the ice-belt. But, upon reaching Refuge Harbour,
I found the snow so heavy and the fragments from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">« 192 »</a></span>
the cliffs so numerous and threatening, that I was obliged
to give it up. A large chasm stopped my advance and
drove me out again upon the floes.</p>

<p>Getting beyond a table-land known as Kasarsoak, or
&ldquo;the big promontory,&rdquo; I emerged from the broken ice
upon a wide plain. Here I first saw with alarm that the
ice had changed its character: the snow which covered it
had become lead-coloured and sodden by the water from
beneath, and ice-fields after ice-fields stretching before me
were all covered with stained patches. As I rode along
these lonely marshes, for such they were, the increased
labour of the dogs admonished me that the floe was no
longer to be trusted. It chilled my heart to remember the
position of our boats and stores. Nearly nine hundred
pounds of food, exclusive of the load now upon my sledge,
were still awaiting transportation at Anoatok.</p>

<p>Two hundred more, including our shot and bullet-bags,
were at the Cape Hatherton station; and Metek&rsquo;s load was
probably by this time lying on the ice opposite M&rsquo;Gary
Island. Like Robinson Crusoe with his powder, the reflection
came over me:&mdash;&ldquo;Good God! what will become
of us if all this is destroyed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only by men experienced in the rapid changes of Arctic
ice can the full force of this reflection be appreciated. A
single gale might convert the precarious platform, over
which we were travelling, into a tumultuous ice-pack.
Had the boats their stores on board even, and could they
break through without foundering, there was not the
remotest prospect of their being liberated in open water;
and I knew well what obstacles a wet, sludy surface would
present to our over-tasked and almost worn-out party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Equimaux at Etah</div>

<p>I determined, therefore, as soon as I could secure the
meat, which was my immediate errand, to make a requisition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">« 193 »</a></span>
upon the Esquimaux for two of the four dogs which
were still at Etah, and by their aid to place the provisions
in safety. The north cape of Littleton Island, afterward
called Point Security, was selected for the purpose, and I
left orders with the invalids at the sick station to be in
readiness for instant removal. I pursued my journey alone.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the evening when I drew near Etah.
I mean that it was verging on to our midnight, the sun
being low in the heavens, and the air breathing that
solemn stillness which belongs to the sleeping-time of birds
and plants. I had not quite reached the little settlement
when loud sounds of laughter came to my ear; and, turning
the cape, I burst suddenly upon an encampment of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Some thirty men, women, and children, were gathered
together upon a little face of offal-stained rock. Except a
bank of moss, which broke the wind-draught from the
fiord, they were entirely without protection from the
weather, though the temperature was 5&deg; below zero. The
huts were completely deserted, the snow-tossut had fallen
in, and the window was as free and open as summer to the
purifying air. Every living thing about the settlement
was out upon the bare rocks.</p>

<p>The fires were of peat-moss, greased with the fat of the
bird-skins. They were used only for cooking, however,
the people depending for comfort on the warmth of close
contact. Old Kresuk, the blind patriarch of the settlement,
was the favoured centre, and around him, as a focus, was
a coil of men, women, and children, as perplexing to
unravel as a skein of eels. The children alone were toddling
about and bringing in stores of moss, their faces
smeared with blood, and tit-bits of raw liver between their
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">« 194 »</a></span></p>

<p>The scene was redolent of plenty and indolence,&mdash;the
<i>dolce far niente</i> of the short-lived Esquimaux summer.
Provision for the dark winter was furthest from their
thoughts; for, although the rocks were patched with sun-dried
birds, a single hunting-party from Peteravik could
have eaten up their entire supplies in a night.</p>

<p>The dogs seemed as happy as their masters: they were
tethered by seal-skin thongs to prevent robbery, but evidently
fed to the full extent of their capacity.</p>

<p>Aningnah, wife of Marsumah, was one of the presiding
deities of the soup-pot, or rather first witch of the caldron.
She was a tall, well-made woman, and, next to Mrs Metek,
had a larger influence than any female in the settlement.</p>

<p>During one of my visits to the settlement, I had relieved
her from much suffering by opening a furuncle, and the
kind creature never lost an opportunity of showing how
she remembered it. Poor old Kresuk was summarily
banished from his central seat of honour, and the nalegak
installed in his place. She stripped herself of her bird-skin
kapetah to make me a coverlet, and gave me her two-year-old
baby for a pillow. There was a little commotion in the
tangled mass of humanity as I crawled over them to accept
these proffered hospitalities; but it was all of a welcoming
sort. I had learned by this time to take kindly and condescendingly
the privileges of my rank; and, with my
inner man well refreshed with auk-livers, I was soon asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning I left my own tired dogs in charge of
Marsumah, quite confident that his wife would feed them
faithfully, and took from them their only team in unequal
exchange. Such had become our relations with these poor
friends of ours, that such an act of authority would have
gone unquestioned if it had cost them a much graver
sacrifice. They saw the condition of my own travel-broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">« 195 »</a></span>
animals, and were well aware of the sufferings of our party,
so long their neighbours and allies. Old Nessark filled
my sledge with walrus-meat; and two of the young men
joined me on foot, to assist me through the broken ice
between Littleton Island and the mainland.</p>

<p>The sledge-party under Mr Brooks had advanced to
within three miles of the hut when I reached them on my
return. They had found the ice more practicable, and
their health was improving. But their desire for food had
increased proportionally; and, as it was a well-understood
rule of our commissariat not to touch the reserved provision
of the boats, it became necessary to draw additional
supplies from the brig. The seven hundred pounds of
bread-dust, our entire stock, could not be reduced with
safety.</p>

<p>But the dogs were wanted to advance the contents of
our Anoatok storehouse to the stations further south, and
I resolved to take Tom Hickey with me and walk back for
another baking exploit. It was more of an effort than I
counted on: we were sixteen hours on the ice, and we had
forgotten our gutta-percha eyautick, or slit-goggles. The
glare of the sun as we entered the curve of our ice-cumbered
harbour almost blinded us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bread Baking</div>

<p>Tom had been a baker at home; but he assures me,
with all the authority of an ancient member of the guild,
that our achievement the day we came on board might be
worthy of praise in the &ldquo;old country;&rdquo; Tom knows no
praise more expanded. We kneaded the dough in a large
pickled-cabbage cask, burnt sundry volumes of the &ldquo;Penny
Cyclopædia of Useful Knowledge,&rdquo; and converted, between
duff and loaf, almost a whole barrel of floor into a strong
likeness to the staff of life. It was the last of our stock;
and &ldquo;all the better too,&rdquo; said my improvident comrade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
who retained some of the genius of blundering as well as
the gallantry of his countrymen,&mdash;&ldquo;all the better, sir,
since we&rsquo;ll have no more bread to bake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Godfrey came on with the dogs three days after, to carry
back the fruits of our labour; but an abrupt change of the
weather gave us a howling gale outside, and we were all of
us storm-stayed. It was Sunday, and probably the last
time that two or three would be gathered together in our
dreary cabin. So I took a Bible from one of the bunks,
and we went through the old-times service. It was my
closing act of official duty among my shipmates on board
the poor little craft. I visited her afterward, but none of
them were with me.</p>

<p>I was glad, when I reached the sick-station, to find things
so much better. Everybody was stronger, and, as a consequence,
more cheerful. They had learned housekeeping,
with its courtesies as well as comforts. Their kotluk
would have done credit to Aningnah herself: they had a
dish of tea for us, and a lump of walrus; and they bestirred
themselves, real housewife-fashion, to give us the warm
place and make us comfortable. I was right sorry to leave
them, for the snow outside was drifting with the gale; but
after a little while the dogs struck the track of the sledges,
and following it with unerring instinct, did not slacken their
pace till they had brought us to our companions on the floe.</p>

<p>They had wisely halted on account of the storm; and,
with their three little boats drawn up side by side for
mutual protection, had been lying to for the past two days,
tightly housed, and moored fast by whale-lines to the ice.
But the drifts had almost buried the <i>Hope</i>, which was the
windward boat; and when I saw the burly form of Brooks
emerging from the snow-covered roof, I could have fancied
it a walrus rising through the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disheartening Work</div>

<p>They had found it hard travel, but were doing well.
Brooks&rsquo;s provision-report was the old story,&mdash;out of meat
and nearly out of bread&mdash;no pleasant news for a tired-out
man, who saw in this the necessity of another trip to
Etah. I was only too glad, however, to see that their
appetites held, for with the animal man, as with all others,
while he feeds he lives.</p>

<p>Six Esquimaux, three of them women&mdash;that ugly beauty,
Nessark&rsquo;s wife, at the head of them&mdash;had come off to the
boats for shelter from the gale. They seemed so entirely
deferential, and to recognise with such simple trust our
mutual relations of alliance, that I resolved to drive down
to Etah with Petersen as interpreter, and formally claim
assistance, according to their own laws, on the ground of
our established brotherhood. I had thought of this before;
but both Marsumah and Metek had been so engrossed with
their bird-catching that I was loath to take them from
their families.</p>

<p>After further consideration, I determined to send Morton;
so Petersen and myself gave up the sledge to him, and,
along with Marsumah and Nessark, he set out at once to
negotiate at Etah, while I took my place with the sledge-parties.</p>

<p>The 6th saw the same disheartening work. The ice was
almost impassable. Both sick and well worked at the
drag-ropes alike, and hardly a man but was constantly wet
to the skin. Fearing for the invalids at the sick-station in
case we should be cut off from them, I sent for Mr Goodfellow
at once, and gave orders for the rest to be in readiness
for removal at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>The next day Morton returned from Etah. The natives
had responded to the brotherly appeal of the nalegak; and
they came down from the settlement, bringing a full supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span>
of meat and blubber, and every sound dog that belonged
to them. I had now once more a serviceable team. The
comfort and security of such a possession to men in our
critical position can hardly be realised. It was more than
an addition of ten strong men to our party. I set off at
once with Metek to glean from the brig her last remnant
of slush (tallow), and to bring down the sick men from
Anoatok.</p>

<p>Our visit to the brig was soon over: we had very few
stores to remove. I trod her solitary deck for the last
time, and returned with Metek to his sledge.</p>

<p>I had left the party on the floes with many apprehensions
for their safety, and the result proved they were not
without cause. While crossing a &ldquo;tide-hole,&rdquo; one of the
runners of the <i>Hope&rsquo;s</i> sledge broke through, and, but for
the strength and presence of mind of Ohlsen, the boat
would have gone under. He saw the ice give way, and,
by a violent exercise of strength, passed a capstan-bar under
the sledge, and thus bore the load till it was hauled on to
safer ice. He was a very powerful man, and might have
done this without injuring himself; but it would seem his
footing gave way under him, forcing him to make a still
more desperate effort to extricate himself. It cost him his
life&mdash;he died three days afterwards.</p>

<p>I was bringing down George Stephenson from the sick-station,
and my sledge being heavily laden, I had just
crossed, with some anxiety, near the spot at which the
accident occurred. A little way beyond we met Mr Ohlsen,
seated upon a lump of ice, and very pale. He pointed to
the camp about three miles further on, and told us, in a
faint voice, that he had not detained the party; he &ldquo;had
a little cramp in the small of the back,&rdquo; but would soon be
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">« 199 »</a></span></p>

<p>I put him at once in Stephenson&rsquo;s place, and drove him
on to the <i>Faith</i>. Here he was placed in the stern-sheets
of the boat, and well muffled up in our best buffalo-robes.
During all that night he was assiduously attended by Dr
Hayes; but he sank rapidly. His symptoms had from the
first a certain obscure but fatal resemblance to our winter&rsquo;s
tetanus, which filled us with forebodings.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 6, after stowing away our disabled
comrade in the <i>Faith</i>, we again set all hands at the drag-ropes.
The ice ahead of us bore the same character as the
day before&mdash;no better; we were all perceptibly weaker,
and much disheartened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sledging Under Sail</div>

<p>We had been tugging in harness about two hours, when
a breeze set in from the northward, the first that we had
felt since crossing Bedevilled Reach. We got out our long
steering-oar as a boom, and made sail upon the boats.
The wind freshened almost to a gale; and, heading toward
the depôt on Littleton Island, we ran gallantly before it.</p>

<p>It was a new sensation to our foot-sore men, this sailing
over solid ice. Levels which, under the slow labour of the
drag-ropes, would have delayed us for hours, were glided
over without a halt. We thought it dangerous work at
first, but the speed of the sledges made rotten ice nearly as
available as sound. The men could see plainly that they
were approaching new landmarks, and leaving old ones
behind. Their spirits rose; the sick mounted the thwarts,
the well clung to the gunwale; and, for the first time for
nearly a year, broke out the sailor&rsquo;s chorus, &ldquo;Storm along,
my hearty boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We must have made a greater distance in this single day
than in the five that preceded it. We encamped at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
near a small berg, which gave us plenty of fresh water,
after a progress of at least eight miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">« 200 »</a></span></p>

<p>As we were halting, I saw two Esquimaux on the ice
toward Life-Boat Cove; and the well-known &ldquo;Huk! huuk!&rdquo;
a sort of masonic signal among them, soon brought them
to us. They turned out to be Sip-su and old Nessark.
They were the bearers of good news: my dogs were
refreshed and nearly able to travel again; and, as they
volunteered to do me service, I harnessed up our united
teams, and despatched Nessark to the hut to bring down
Mr Wilson and George Whipple.</p>

<p>We expected now to have our whole party together
again; and the day would have been an active cheering
one throughout, but for the condition of poor Ohlsen, who
was growing rapidly worse.</p>

<p>From this time we went on for some days, aided by our
sails, meeting with accidents occasionally&mdash;the giving way
of a spar or the falling of some of the party through the
spongy ice&mdash;and occasionally, when the floe was altogether
too infirm, labouring our way with great difficulty upon
the ice-belt.</p>

<p>One only was absent of all the party that remained on
our rolls. Hans, the kind son and ardent young lover of
Fiskernaes, my well-trusted friend, had been missing for
nearly two months. I am loath to tell the story as I
believe it, for it may not be the true one after all, and I
would not intimate an unwarranted doubt of the constancy
of boyish love. But I must explain, as far as I can at
least, why he was not with us when we first looked at the
open water. Just before my departure for my April hunt,
Hans came to me with a long face, asking permission to
visit Peteravik: &ldquo;he had no boots, and wanted to lay in a
stock of walrus-hide for soles; he did not need the dogs;
he would rather walk.&rdquo; It was a long march, but he was
well practised in it, and I consented of course. Both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">« 201 »</a></span>
Petersen and myself gave him commissions to execute, and
he left us, intending to stop by the way at Etah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hans the Faithless</div>

<p>In our labours of the next month we missed Hans much.
He had not yet returned, and the stories of him that came
to us from Etah were the theme of much conversation and
surmise among us. He had certainly called there as he
promised, and given to Nessark&rsquo;s wife an order for a pair
of boots, and he had then wended his way across the big
headland to Peteravik, where Shang-hu and his pretty
daughter had their home. This intimation was given with
many an explanatory grin; for Hans was a favourite with
all, the fair especially, and, as a <i>match</i>, one of the greatest
men in the country. It required all my recollections of
his &ldquo;old love&rdquo; to make me suspend my judgment; for the
boots came, as if to confirm the scandal. I never failed in
my efforts afterward to find his whereabouts, and went out
of our way to interrogate this and that settlement; for,
independent of everything like duty, I was very fond of
him. But the story was everywhere the same. Hans the
faithful&mdash;yet, I fear, the faithless&mdash;was last seen upon a
native sledge, driving south from Peteravik, with a maiden
at his side, and professedly bound to a new principality at
Uwarrow Suk-suk, high up Murchison&rsquo;s Sound. Alas for
Hans, the married man!</p>

<p>Though the condition of the ice assured us that we were
drawing near the end of our sledge-journeys, it by no means
diminished their difficulty or hazards. The part of the
field near the open water is always abraded by the currents,
while it remains apparently firm on the surface. In
some places it was so transparent that we could even
see the gurgling eddies below it; while in others it was
worn into open holes that were already the resort of
wildfowl. But in general it looked hard and plausible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">« 202 »</a></span>
though no more than a foot or even six inches in thickness.</p>

<p>This continued to be its character as long as we pursued
the Littleton Island channel, and we were compelled, the
whole way through, to sound ahead with the boat-hook or
narwhal-horn. We learned this precaution from the Esquimaux,
who always move in advance of their sledges when
the ice is treacherous, and test its strength before bringing
on their teams. Our first warning impressed us with the
policy of observing it. We were making wide circuits
with the whale-boats to avoid the tide-holes, when signals
of distress from men scrambling on the ice announced to
us that the <i>Red Eric</i> had disappeared. This unfortunate
little craft contained all the dearly-earned documents of
the expedition. There was not a man who did not feel
that the reputation of the party rested in a great degree
upon their preservation. It had cost us many a pang to
give up our collections of natural history, to which every
one had contributed his quota of labour and interest; but
the destruction of the vouchers of the cruise&mdash;the log-books,
the meteorological registers, the surveys, and the
journals&mdash;seemed to strike them all as an irreparable
disaster.</p>

<p>When I reached the boat everything was in confusion.
Blake, with a line passed round his waist, was standing up
to his knees in sludge, groping for the document-box; and
Mr Bonsall, dripping wet, was endeavouring to haul the
provision-bags to a place of safety. Happily the boat was
our lightest one, and everything was saved. She was
gradually lightened until she could bear a man, and her
cargo was then passed out by a line and hauled upon the
ice. In spite of the wet and the cold, and our thoughts of
poor Ohlsen, we greeted its safety with three cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">« 203 »</a></span></p>

<p>It was by great good fortune that no lives were lost.
Stephenson was caught as he sank by one of the sledge-runners,
and Morton, while in the very act of drifting under
the ice, was seized by the hair of the head by Mr Bonsall
and saved.</p>

<p>We were now close upon Life-boat Cove, where nearly
two years before we had made provision for just such a
contingency as that which was now before us. Buried
under the frozen soil, our stores had escaped even the keen
scrutiny of our savage allies, and we now turned to them
as essential to our relief. Mr M&rsquo;Gary was sent to the
<i>cache</i>, with orders to bring everything except the salt beef.
This had been so long a poison to us that, tainted as we
were by scurvy, I was afraid to bring it among those who
might be tempted to indulge in it.</p>

<p>On the 12th the boats and sledges came to a halt in the
narrow passage between the islands opposite Cape Misery,
the scene of our late snow storm. All our cargo had been
gathered together at this spot, and the rocks were covered
with our stores. Out of the fourteen hundred pounds not
an ounce had been sacrificed. Everything was cased in its
waterproof covering, and as dry and perfect as when it had
left the brig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Ohlsen</div>

<p>I was with the advance boat, trying to force a way
through the channel, when the report came to me from Dr
Hayes that Ohlsen was no more. He had shown, a short
half hour before, some signs of revival, and Petersen had
gone out to kill a few birds, in the hope of possibly sustaining
him by a concentrated soup. But it was in vain: the
poor fellow flushed up only to die a few minutes after.</p>

<p>We had no time to mourn the loss of our comrade, a
tried and courageous man, who met his death in the gallant
discharge of duty. It cast a gloom over the whole party;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">« 204 »</a></span>
but the exigencies of the moment were upon us, and we
knew not whose turn would come next, or how soon we
might all of us follow him together.</p>

<p>The body of Mr Ohlsen was sewed up, while they were
gone, in his own blankets, and carried in procession to the
head of a little gorge on the east face of Pekiutlik, where
by hard labour we consigned his remains to a sort of trench,
and covered them with rocks to protect them from the fox
and bear. Without the knowledge of my comrades, I encroached
on our little store of sheet-lead, which we were
husbanding to mend our leaky boats with, and, cutting on
a small tablet his name and age&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="caption3nb gesspert">CHRISTIAN OHLSEN,</span><br />
AGED 36 YEARS,<br />
</p>

<p>laid it on his manly breast. The cape that looks down on
him bears his name.</p>

<p>We gave two quiet hours to the memory of our dead
brother, and then resumed our toilsome march. We kept
up nearly the same routine as before; but, as we neared
the settlements, the Esquimaux came in flocks to our
assistance. They volunteered to aid us at the drag-ropes.
They carried our sick upon hand-sledges. They relieved
us of all care for our supplies of daily food. The quantity
of little auks that they brought us was enormous. They
fed us and our dogs at the rate of eight thousand birds a
week, all of them caught in their little hand-nets. All
anxiety left us for the time. The men broke out in their
old forecastle songs; the sledges began to move merrily
ahead, and laugh and jest drove out the old moody silence.</p>

<p>My little note-book closes for the week with this gratefully-expounded
record:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Open Water</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>June 16.</i>&mdash;Our boats are at the open water. We see
its deep indigo horizon, and hear its roar against the icy
beach. Its scent is in our nostrils and our hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our camp is but three-quarters of a mile from the sea;
it is at the northern curve of the North Baffin polynia.
We must reach it at the southern sweep of Etah Bay,
about three miles from Cape Alexander. A dark headland
defines the spot. It is more marked than the southern
entrance of Smith&rsquo;s Straits. How magnificently the surf
beats against its sides! There are ridges of squeezed ice
between us and it, and a broad zone of floating sludge is
swelling and rolling sluggishly along its margin&mdash;formidable
barriers to boats and sledges. But we have mastered
worse obstacles, and by God&rsquo;s help we will master these.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">OUR MARCH OVER LAND AND SEA.</p>


<p class="p0">We had our boats to prepare now for a long and adventurous
navigation. They were so small and heavily laden as
hardly to justify much confidence in their buoyancy; but,
besides this, they were split with frost and warped by sunshine,
and fairly open at the seams. They were to be
calked, and swelled, and launched, and stowed, before we
could venture to embark in them. A rainy south-wester
too, which had met us on our arrival, was now spreading
with its black nimbus over the bay, and it looked as if we
were to be storm stayed on the precarious ice beach. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">« 206 »</a></span>
was a time of anxiety, but to me personally of comparative
rest. I resumed my journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>July 18.</i>&mdash;The Esquimaux are camped by our side,&mdash;the
whole settlement of Etah congregated around the &lsquo;big
caldron&rsquo; of Cape Alexander, to bid us good-bye. There
are Metek and Nualik his wife, our old acquaintance Mrs
Eider-duck, and their five children, commencing with
Myouk, my body-guard, and ending with the ventricose
little Accomodah. There is Nessark and Anak his wife;
and Tellerk the &lsquo;Right Arm,&rsquo; and Amaunalik his wife;
and Sip-su, and Marsumah and Aningnah&mdash;and who not?
I can name them every one, and they know us as well.
We have found brothers in a strange land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each one has a knife, or a file, or a saw, or some such
treasured keepsake; and the children have a lump of soap,
the greatest of all great medicines. The merry little
urchins break in upon me even now as I am writing&mdash;&lsquo;Kuyanake,
kuyanake, Nalegak-soak!&rsquo; &lsquo;Thank you,
thank you, big chief!&rsquo; while Myouk is crowding fresh presents
of raw birds on me as if I could eat for ever, and
poor Aningnah is crying beside the tent-curtain, wiping
her eyes on a bird skin!</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart warms to these poor, dirty, miserable, yet
happy beings, so long our neighbours, and of late so
staunchly our friends. Theirs is no affectation of regret.
There are twenty-two of them around me, all busy in good
offices to the Docto Kayens; and there are only two women
and the old blind patriarch Kresuk, &lsquo;Drift-wood,&rsquo; left
behind at the settlement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see! more of them are coming up&mdash;boys ten years
old pushing forward babies on their sledges. The whole
nation is gipsying with us upon the icy meadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cook for them in our big camp-kettle; they sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">« 207 »</a></span>
in the <i>Red Eric</i>: a berg close at hand supplies them with
water; and thus, rich in all that they value,&mdash;sleep, and
food, and drink, and companionship,&mdash;with their treasured
short-lived summer sun above them, the <i>beau ideal</i> and
sum of Esquimaux blessings, they seem supremely happy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parting With the Esquimaux</div>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever may have been the faults of these Esquimaux
heretofore, stealing was the only grave one. Treachery
they may have conceived; and I have reason to believe
that, under superstitious fears of an evil influence from our
presence, they would at one time have been glad to destroy
us. But the day of all this has passed away. When
trouble came to us and to them, and we bent ourselves to
their habits,&mdash;when we looked to them to procure us fresh
meat, and they found at our poor Oomiak-soak shelter and
protection during their wild bear-hunts,&mdash;then we were so
blended in our interests as well as modes of life, that every
trace of enmity wore away. God knows that since they
professed friendship&mdash;albeit the imaginary powers of the
angekok-soak and the marvellous six-shooter which attested
them may have had their influence&mdash;never have friends
been more true. Although, since Ohlsen&rsquo;s death, numberless
articles of inestimable value to them have been scattered
upon the ice unwatched, they have not stolen a nail. It
was only yesterday that Metek, upon my alluding to the
manner in which property of all sorts was exposed without
pilfering, explained through Petersen, in these two short
sentences, the argument of their morality:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have done us good. We are not hungry; we
will not take (steal).&mdash;&mdash;You have done us good; we want
to help you; we are friends.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made my last visit to Etah while we were waiting the
issue of the storm. I saw old Kresuk (Drift-wood) the
blind man, and listened to his long good-bye talk. I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">« 208 »</a></span>
passed with the Esquimaux as an angekok, in virtue of
some simple exploits of natural magic; and it was one of the
regular old-times entertainments of our visitors at the brig,
to see my hand terrible with blazing ether, while it lifted
nails with the magnet. I tried now to communicate a
portion of my wonder-working talent. I made a lens of
ice before them, and &ldquo;drew down the sun,&rdquo; so as to light
the moss under their kolupsut. I did not quite understand
old Kresuk, and I was not quite sure he understood himself.
But I trusted to the others to explain to him what
I had done, and burned the back of his hand for a testimony
in the most friendly manner. After all which, with
a reputation for wisdom which I dare say will live in their
short annals, I wended my way to the brig again.</p>

<p>We renewed our queries about Hans, but could get no
further news of him. The last story is, that the poor boy
and his better-half were seen leaving Peteravik, &ldquo;the halting-place,&rdquo;
in company with Shang-hu and one of his big
sons. Lover as he was, and nalegak by the all-hail hereafter,
joy go with him, for he was a right good fellow.</p>

<p>We had quite a scene distributing our last presents.
My amputating knives, the great gift of all, went to Metek
and Nessark; but every one had something as his special
prize. Our dogs went to the community at large, as
tenants in common, except Toodlamick and Whitey, our
representative dogs through very many trials; I could not
part with them, the leaders of my team.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Farewell!</div>

<p>And now it only remained for us to make our farewell
to these desolate and confiding people. I gathered them
round me on the ice-beach, and talked to them as brothers
for whose kindness I had still a return to make. I told
them what I knew of the tribes from which they were
separated by the glacier and the sea, of the resources that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">« 209 »</a></span>
abounded in those less ungenial regions not very far off to
the south, the greater duration of daylight, the less intensity
of the cold, the facilities of the hunt, the frequent
drift-wood, the kayack, and the fishing-net. I tried to explain
to them how, under bold and cautious guidance, they
might reach there in a few seasons of patient march. I
gave them drawings of the coast, with its headlands and
hunting-grounds, as far as Cape Shackleton, and its best
camping-stations from Red Head to the Danish settlements.</p>

<p>They listened with breathless interest, closing their
circle round me; and, as Petersen described the big ussuk,
the white whale, the bear, and the long open water hunts
with the kayack and the rifle, they looked at each other
with a significance not to be misunderstood. They would
anxiously have had me promise that I would some day
return and carry a load of them down to the settlements;
and I shall not wonder if&mdash;guided perhaps by Hans&mdash;they
hereafter attempt the journey without other aid.</p>

<p>It was in the soft subdued light of a Sunday evening,
June 17, that, after hauling our boats with much hard
labour through the hummocks, we stood beside the open
sea-way. Before midnight we had launched the <i>Red Eric</i>,
and given three cheers for Henry Grinnell and &ldquo;homeward
bound,&rdquo; unfurling all our flags.</p>

<p>But we were not yet to embark; for the gale which had
been long brooding now began to dash a heavy <i>wind-lipper</i>
against the floe, and obliged us to retreat before it, hauling
our boats back with each fresh breakage of the ice. It
rose more fiercely, and we were obliged to give way before
it still more. Our goods, which had been stacked upon
the ice, had to be carried further inward. We worked our
way back thus, step by step, before the breaking ice, for
about two hundred yards. At last it became apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">« 210 »</a></span>
that the men must sleep and rest, or sink; and, giving up
for the present all thoughts of embarking, I hauled the
boats at once nearly a mile from the water&rsquo;s edge, where a
large iceberg was frozen tight in the floes.</p>

<p>But here we were still pursued. All the next night it
blew fearfully, and at last our berg crashed away through
the broken ice, and our asylum was destroyed. Again we
fell to hauling back the boats; until, fearing that the continuance
of the gale might induce a ground-swell, which
would have been fatal to us, I came to a halt near the
slope of a low iceberg, on which I felt confident that we
could haul up, in case of the entire disruption of the floes.
The entire area was already intersected with long cracks,
and the surface began to show a perceptible undulation
beneath our feet.</p>

<p>It was well for us I had not gratified the men by taking
the outside track; we should certainly have been rafted off
into the storm, and without an apparent possibility of
escape.</p>

<p>I climbed to the summit of the berg; but it was impossible
to penetrate the obscurity of mist, and spray, and
cloud further than a thousand yards. The sea tore the ice
up almost to the very base of the berg, and all around it
looked like one vast tumultuous caldron, the ice-tables
crashing together in every possible position with deafening
clamour.</p>

<p>The gale died away to a calm, and the water became as
tranquil as if the gale had never been. All hands were
called to prepare for embarking. The boats were stowed,
and the cargo divided between them equally; the sledges
unlashed and slung outside the gunwales; and on Tuesday
the 19th, at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, with the bay as smooth as a garden-lake,
I put off in the <i>Faith</i>. She was followed by the <i>Red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">« 211 »</a></span>
Eric</i> on our quarter, and the <i>Hope</i> astern. In the <i>Faith</i> I
had with me Mr M&rsquo;Gary, and Petersen, Hickey, Stephenson,
and Whipple. Mr Brooks was in the <i>Hope</i>, with
Hayes, Sontag, Morton, Goodfellow, and Blake. Bonsall,
Riley, and Godfrey made the crew of the <i>Eric</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boat Disasters</div>

<p>The wind freshened as we doubled the westernmost point
of Cape Alexander, and, as we looked out on the expanse
of the sound, we saw the kitty-wakes and the ivory-gulls
and jagers dipping their wings in the curling waves. They
seemed the very same birds we had left two years before
screaming and catching fish in the beautiful water. We
tried to make our first rest at Sutherland Island; but we
found it so barricaded by the precipitous ice-belt that it
was impossible to land. I clambered myself from the
boat&rsquo;s mast upon the platform and filled our kettles with
snow, and then, after cooking our supper in the boats, we
stood away for Hakluyt. It was an ugly crossing: we had
a short chopping sea from the south-east; and, after a
while, the <i>Red Eric</i> swamped. Riley and Godfrey managed
to struggle to the <i>Faith</i>, and Bonsall to the <i>Hope</i>: but it
was impossible to remove the cargo of our little comrade;
it was as much as we could do to keep her afloat and let
her tow behind us. Just at this time, too, the <i>Hope</i> made
a signal of distress; and Brooks hailed us to say that she
was making water faster than he could free her.</p>

<p>The wind was hauling round to the westward, and we
could not take the sea abeam. But, as I made a rapid
survey of the area around me, studded already with floating
shreds of floe-ice, I saw ahead the low, grey blink of the
pack. I remembered well the experience of our Beechy
Island trip, and knew that the margin of these large fields
is almost always broken by inlets of open water, which
gave much the same sort of protection as the creeks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">« 212 »</a></span>
rivers of an adverse coast. We were fortunate in finding
one of these, and fastening ourselves to an old floe, alongside
of which our weary men turned in to sleep without
hauling up the boats.</p>

<p>When Petersen and myself returned from an unsuccessful
hunt upon the ice, we found them still asleep, in spite of a
cold and drizzling rain that might have stimulated wakefulness.
I did not disturb them till eight o&rsquo;clock. We then
retreated from our breakwater of refuge, generally pulling
along by the boat-hooks, but sometimes dragging our boats
over the ice; and at last, bending to our oars as the water
opened, reached the shore of Hakluyt Island.</p>

<p>In the morning of the 22d we pushed forward for
Northumberland Island, and succeeded in reaching it a
little to the eastward of my former landing-place.</p>

<p>We crossed Murchison Channel on the 23d, and encamped
for the night on the land-floe at the base of Cape Parry;
a hard day&rsquo;s travel, partly by tracking over ice, partly
through tortuous and zigzag leads. The next day gave us
admirable progress. The ice opened in leads before us,
somewhat tortuous, but, on the whole, favouring, and for
sixteen hours I never left the helm. We were all of us
exhausted when the day&rsquo;s work came to a close.</p>

<p>The next day&rsquo;s progress was of course slow and wearisome,
pushing through alternate ice and water for the
land-belt. We fastened at last to the great floe near the
shore, making our harbour in a crack which opened with
the changes of tide.</p>

<p>The imperfect diet of the party was showing itself more
and more in the decline of their muscular power. They
seemed scarcely aware of it themselves, and referred the
difficulty they found in dragging and pushing to something
uncommon about the ice or sludge, rather than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">« 213 »</a></span>
their own weakness. But, as we endeavoured to renew
our labours through the morning fog, belted in on all sides
by ice-fields so distorted and rugged as to defy our efforts
to cross them, the truth seemed to burst upon every one.
We had lost the feeling of hunger, and were almost satisfied
with our pasty broth and the large draughts of tea which
accompanied it. I was anxious to send our small boat,
the <i>Eric</i>, across to the lumme-hill of Appah, where I knew
from the Esquimaux we should find plenty of birds; but
the strength of the party was insufficient to drag her.</p>

<p>We were sorely disheartened, and could only wait for
the fog to rise, in the hope of some smoother platform than
that which was about us, or some lead that might save us
the painful labour of tracking. I had climbed an iceberg,
and there was nothing in view except Dalrymple Rock,
with its red brassy face towering in the unknown distance.
But I hardly got back to my boat, before a gale struck us
from the north-west, and a floe, taking upon a tongue of
ice about a mile to the north of us, began to swing upon it
like a pivot, and close slowly in upon our narrow resting-place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Ice Nip</div>

<p>At first our own floe also was driven before the wind;
but in a little while it encountered the stationary ice at the
foot of the very rock itself. On the instant the wildest
imaginable ruin rose around us. The men sprang mechanically
each one to his station, bearing back the boats and
stores; but I gave up for the moment all hope of our
escape. It was not a nip, such as is familiar to Arctic
navigators; but the whole platform where we stood, and
for hundreds of yards on every side of us, crumbled, and
crushed, and piled, and tossed itself madly under the pressure.
I do not believe that of our little body of men, all
of them disciplined in trials, able to measure danger while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">« 214 »</a></span>
combating it,&mdash;I do not believe there is one who this day
can explain how or why&mdash;hardly when, in fact&mdash;we found
ourselves afloat. We only know that in the midst of a
clamour utterly indescribable, through which the braying
of a thousand trumpets could no more have been heard
than the voice of a man, we were shaken, and raised, and
whirled, and let down again in a swelling waste of broken
hummocks, and, as the men grasped their boat-hooks in
the stillness that followed, the boats eddied away in a
tumultuous skreed of ice, and snow, and water.</p>

<p>We were borne along in this manner as long as the unbroken
remnant of the in-shore floe continued revolving,&mdash;utterly
powerless, and catching a glimpse every now and
then of the brazen headland that looked down on us
through the snowy sky. At last the floe brought up
against the rocks, the looser fragments that hung round it
began to separate, and we were able by oars and boat-hooks
to force our battered little flotilla clear of them.
To our joyful surprise, we soon found ourselves in a stretch
of the land-water wide enough to give us rowing-room,
and with the assured promise of land close ahead.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the tide was high enough for us to scale
the ice-cliff. One by one we pulled up the boats upon a
narrow shelf, the whole sixteen of us uniting at each pull.
We were too much worn down to unload; but a deep and
narrow gorge opened in the cliffs almost at the spot where
we clambered up; and, as we pushed the boats into it on
an even keel, the rocks seemed to close above our heads,
until an abrupt turn in the course of the ravine placed a
protecting cliff between us and the gale. We were completely
encaved.</p>

<p>Just as we had brought in the last boat, the <i>Red Eric</i>,
and were shoring her up with blocks of ice, a long-unused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">« 215 »</a></span>
but familiar and unmistakable sound startled and gladdened
every ear, and a flock of eiders darkening the sky for a
moment passed swiftly in front of us. We knew that we
must be at their breeding-grounds; and as we turned in
wet and hungry to our long-coveted sleep, it was only to
dream of eggs and abundance.</p>

<p>We remained almost three days in our crystal retreat,
gathering eggs at the rate of twelve hundred a day. Outside,
the storm raged without intermission, and our egg-hunters
found it difficult to keep their feet; but a merrier
set of gourmands than were gathered within never surfeited
on genial diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;Weary Man&rsquo;s Rest&rdquo;</div>

<p>On the 3d of July the wind began to moderate, though
the snow still fell heavily; and the next morning, after a
patriotic egg-nog, the liquor borrowed grudgingly from our
alcohol-flask, and diluted till it was worthy of temperance
praise, we lowered our boats, and bade a grateful farewell
to &ldquo;Weary Man&rsquo;s Rest.&rdquo; We rowed to the south-east end
of Wostenholme Island; but the tide left us there, and we
moved to the ice-foot.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the birds, which had been so abundant
when we left Dalrymple&rsquo;s Island, and which we had counted
on for a continuous store, seemed to have been driven out
by the storm. We were again reduced to short daily
rations of bread-dust, and I was aware that the change of
diet could not fail to tell upon the strength and energies
of the party. I determined to keep in-shore, in spite of
the barricades of ice, in the hope of renewing, to some extent
at least, our supplies of game. We were fifty-two
hours in forcing this rugged passage: a most painful labour,
which, but for the disciplined endurance of the men, might
well have been deemed impracticable.</p>

<p>Once through the barrier, the leads began to open again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">« 216 »</a></span>,
and on the 11th we found ourselves approaching Cape
Dudley Digges, with a light breeze from the north-west.
It looked for some hours as if our troubles were over, when
a glacier came in sight not laid down on the charts, whose
tongue of floe extended still further out to sea than the
one we had just passed with so much labour. Our first
resolve was to double it at all hazards, for our crews were
too much weakened to justify another tracking through
the hummocks, and the soft snow which covered the land-floes
was an obstacle quite insuperable. Nevertheless, we
forced our way into a lead of sludge, mingled with the
comminuted ice of the glacier; but the only result was a
lesson of gratitude for our escape from it. Our frail and
weather-worn boats were quite unequal to the duty.</p>

<p>I again climbed the nearest berg,&mdash;for these ice-mountains
were to us like the look-out hills of men at home,&mdash;and
surveyed the ice to the south far on toward Cape
York. My eyes never looked on a spectacle more painful.
We were in advance of the season: the floes had not broken
up. There was no &ldquo;western water.&rdquo; Here, in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>,
between two barriers, both impassable to men in our
condition, with stores miserably inadequate and strength
broken down, we were to wait till the tardy summer should
open to us a way.</p>

<p>I headed for the cliffs. Desolate and frowning as they
were, it was better to reach them and halt upon the inhospitable
shore than await the fruitless ventures of the
sea. A narrow lead, a mere fissure at the edge of the land-ice,
ended opposite a low platform; we had traced its
whole extent, and it landed us close under the shadow of
the precipitous shore.</p>

<p>Providence Retreat, as I called this spot, abounded in
life. We found the lumme, nearly as large as canvas-backs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">« 217 »</a></span>
and, as we thought, altogether sweeter and more
juicy; their eggs, well known as delicacies on the Labrador
coast; the cochlearia, growing superbly on the guano-coated
surface;&mdash;all of them in endless abundance: imagine
such a combination of charms for scurvy-broken, hungry-stricken
men.</p>

<p>I could not allow the fuel for a fire, our slush and tallow
being reduced to very little more than a hundred pounds.
The more curious in the art of cooking made experiments
upon the organic matters within their reach,&mdash;the dried
nests of the kitty-wake, the sods of poa, the heavy mosses,
and the fatty skins of the birds around us. But they
would none of them burn; and the most fastidious consoled
himself at last with the doubt whether heat, though
concentrating flavour, might not impair some other excellence.
We limited ourselves to an average of a bird a-piece
per meal,&mdash;of choice, not of necessity,&mdash;and renewed the
zest of the table with the best salad in the world&mdash;raw
eggs and cochlearia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Providence Halt</div>

<p>It was one glorious holiday, our week at Providence
Halt; so full of refreshment and all-happy thoughts, that I
never allowed myself to detract from it by acknowledging
that it was other than premeditated. There were only two
of the party who had looked out with me on the bleak ice-field
ahead, and them I had pledged to silence.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July the aspects of the ice about us gave
me the hope of progress. We had prepared ourselves for
the new encounter with the sea and its trials by laying in
a store of lumme; two hundred and fifty of which had
been duly skinned, spread open, and dried on the rocks,
as the entremets of our bread-dust and tallow.</p>

<p>My journal tells of disaster in its record of our setting-out.
In launching the <i>Hope</i> from the frail and perishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">« 218 »</a></span>
ice-wharf on which we found our first refuge from the
gale, she was precipitated into the sludge below, carrying
away rail and bulwark, losing overboard our best shot-gun,
Bonsall&rsquo;s favourite, and, worst of all, that universal
favourite, our kettle,&mdash;soup-kettle, paste-kettle, tea-kettle,
water-kettle, in one. I may mention, before I pass, that
the kettle found its substitute and successor in the remains
of a tin-can which a good aunt of mine had filled with
ginger-nuts two years before, and which had long survived
the condiments that once gave it dignity. &ldquo;Such are the
uses of adversity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our descent to the coast followed the margin of the fast
ice. After passing the Crimson Cliffs of Sir John Ross, it
wore almost the dress of a holiday excursion,&mdash;a rude one
perhaps, yet truly one in feeling. Our course, except
where a protruding glacier interfered with it, was nearly
parallel to the shore. The birds along it were rejoicing in
the young summer, and when we halted it was upon some
green-clothed cape near a stream of water from the ice-fields
above. Our sportsmen would clamber up the cliffs
and come back laden with little auks; great generous
fires of turf, that cost nothing but the toil of gathering,
blazed merrily; and our happy oarsmen, after a long day&rsquo;s
work, made easy by the promise ahead, would stretch
themselves in the sunshine and dream happily away
till called to the morning wash and prayers. We enjoyed
it the more, for we all of us knew that it could not
last.</p>

<p>We reached Cape York on the 21st, after a tortuous but
romantic travel through a misty atmosphere. Here the
land-leads ceased, with the exception of some small and
scarcely-practicable openings near the shore, which were
evidently owing to the wind that prevailed for the time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">« 219 »</a></span>
Everything bore proof of the late development of the
season. The red snow was a fortnight behind its time.
A fast floe extended with numerous tongues far out to the
south and east. The only question was between a new
rest for the shore-ices to open, or a desertion of the coast,
and a trial of the open water to the west.</p>

<p>We sent off a detachment to see whether the Esquimaux
might not be passing the summer at Episok, behind the
glacier of Cape Imalik, and began an inventory of our
stock on hand.</p>

<p>On their return they gave us no reason to hesitate.
The Esquimaux had not been there for several years.
There were no birds in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I called my officers together, explained to them the
motives which governed me, and prepared to re-embark.
The boats were hauled up, examined carefully, and, as far
as our means permitted, repaired. The <i>Red Eric</i> was
stripped of her outfit and cargo, to be broken up for fuel
when the occasion should come. A large beacon-cairn was
built on an eminence, open to view from the south and
west; and a red flannel shirt, spared with some reluctance,
was hoisted as a pennant to draw attention to the spot.
Here I deposited a succinct record of our condition and
purposes, and then directed our course south by west into
the ice-fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Way Lost</div>

<p>I was awakened one evening from a weary sleep in my
fox-skins, to discover that we had fairly lost our way.
The officer at the helm of the leading boat, misled by the
irregular shape of a large iceberg that crossed his track,
had lost the main lead some time before, and was steering
shore-ward far out of the true course. The little canal in
which he had locked us was hardly two boats&rsquo;-lengths
across, and lost itself not far off in a feeble zigzag both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">« 220 »</a></span>
behind and before us: it was evidently closing, and we
could not retreat.</p>

<p>Without apprising the men of our misadventure, I
ordered the boats to be hauled up, and, under pretence of
drying the clothing and stores, made a camp on the ice.
A few hours after, the weather cleared enough for the first
time to allow a view of the distance, and M&rsquo;Gary and myself
climbed a berg some three hundred feet high for the
purpose. It was truly fearful: we were deep in the recesses
of the bay, surrounded on all sides by stupendous icebergs
and tangled floe-pieces. My sturdy second officer, not
naturally impressible, and long accustomed to the vicissitudes
of whaling life, shed tears at the prospect.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to be done: cost what it might,
we must harness our sledges again and retrace our way to
the westward. One sledge had been already used for firewood;
the <i>Red Eric</i>, to which it had belonged, was now
cut up, and her light cedar planking laid upon the floor of
the other boats; and we went to work with the rue-raddies
as in the olden time. It was not till the third toilsome
day was well spent that we reached the berg which had
bewildered our helmsman. We hauled over its tongue,
and joyously embarked again upon a free lead, with a fine
breeze from the north.</p>

<p>Our little squadron was now reduced to two boats. The
land to the northward was no longer visible; and whenever
I left the margin of the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; to avoid its deep sinuosities,
I was obliged to trust entirely to the compass. We
had at least eight days&rsquo; allowance of fuel on board; but
our provisions were running very low, and we met few
birds, and failed to secure any larger game. We saw
several large seals upon the ice, but they were too watchful
for us; and on two occasions we came upon the walrus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">« 221 »</a></span>
sleeping,&mdash;once within actual lance-thrust; but the animal
charged in the teeth of his assailant and made good his
retreat.</p>

<p>Although the low diet and exposure to wet had again
reduced our party, there was no apparent relaxation of
energy; and it was not until some days later that I found
their strength seriously giving way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Boats in Danger</div>

<p>I well remember our look of blank amazement as, one
day, the order being given to haul the <i>Hope</i> over a tongue
of ice, we found that she would not budge. At first I
thought it was owing to the wetness of the snow-covered
surface in which her runners were; but, as there was a
heavy gale blowing outside, and I was extremely anxious
to get her on to a larger floe to prevent being drifted
off, I lightened her cargo and set both crews upon her.
In the land of promise off Crimson Cliffs, such a force
would have trundled her like a wheelbarrow: we could
almost have borne her upon our backs. Now, with incessant
labour and standing hauls, she moved at a snail&rsquo;s
pace.</p>

<p>The <i>Faith</i> was left behind, and barely escaped destruction.
The outside pressure cleft the floe asunder, and we
saw our best boat, with all our stores, drifting rapidly
away from us. The sight produced an almost hysterical
impression upon our party. Two days&rsquo; want of bread, I
am sure, would have destroyed us; and we had now left
us but eight pounds of shot in all. To launch the <i>Hope</i>
again, and rescue her comrade or share her fortunes,
would have been the instinct of other circumstances; but
it was out of the question now. Happily, before we had
time to ponder our loss, a flat cake of ice eddied round
near the floe we were upon, M&rsquo;Gary and myself sprang to
it at the moment, and succeeded in floating it across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">« 222 »</a></span>
chasm in time to secure her. The rest of the crew rejoined
her by only scrambling over the crushed ice as we brought
her in at the hummock-lines.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">STARVATION&mdash;PLENTY&mdash;THE ESCAPE WELCOME.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Things</span> grew worse and worse with us: the old difficulty
of breathing came back again, and our feet swelled to such
an extent that we were obliged to cut open our canvas
boots. But the symptom which gave me most uneasiness
was our inability to sleep. A form of low fever which
hung by us when at work had been kept down by the
thoroughness of our daily rest; all my hopes of escape
were in the refreshing influences of the halt.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis of our fortunes that we saw a large
seal floating&mdash;as is the custom of these animals&mdash;on a
small patch of ice, and seemingly asleep. It was an ussuk,
and so large that I at first mistook it for a walrus. Signal
was made for the <i>Hope</i> to follow astern, and, trembling
with anxiety, we prepared to crawl down upon him.</p>

<p>Petersen, with the large English rifle, was stationed in the
bow, and stockings were drawn over the oars as mufflers.
As we neared the animal, our excitement became so intense
that the men could hardly keep stroke. I had a set of
signals for such occasions, which spared us the noise of the
voice; and when about three hundred yards off, the oars
were taken in, and we moved on in deep silence with a
single scull astern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">« 223 »</a></span></p>

<p>He was not asleep, for he reared his head when we were
almost within rifle-shot; and to this day I can remember
the hard, care-worn, almost despairing expression of the
men&rsquo;s thin faces as they saw him move: their lives depended
on his capture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capturing a Seal</div>

<p>I depressed my hand nervously, as a signal for Petersen
to fire. M&rsquo;Gary hung upon his oar, and the boat, slowly
but noiselessly sagging ahead, seemed to me without certain
range. Looking at Petersen, I saw that the poor fellow
was paralysed by his anxiety, trying vainly to obtain a rest
for his gun against the cut-water of the boat. The seal
rose on his four-flippers, gazed at us for a moment with
frightened curiosity, and coiled himself for a plunge. At
that instant, simultaneously with the crack of our rifle, he
relaxed his long length on the ice, and, at the very brink
of the water, his head fell helpless to one side.</p>

<p>I would have ordered another shot, but no discipline
could have controlled the men. With a wild yell, each
vociferating according to his own impulse, they urged both
boats upon the floes. A crowd of hands seized the seal
and bore him up to safer ice. The men seemed half crazy;
I had not realised how much we were reduced by absolute
famine. They ran over the floe, crying and laughing, and
brandishing their knives. It was not five minutes before
every man was sucking his bloody fingers or eating long
strips of raw blubber.</p>

<p>That night, on the large halting-floe, to which, in contempt
of the dangers of drifting, we happy men had hauled
our boats, two entire planks of the <i>Red Eric</i> were devoted
to a grand cooking-fire, and we enjoyed a rare and savage
feast.</p>

<p>This was our last experience of the disagreeable effects
of hunger. In the words of George Stephenson, &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">« 224 »</a></span>
charm was broken, and the dogs were safe.&rdquo; The dogs I
have said little about, for none of us liked to think of
them. The poor creatures, Toodla and Whitey, had been
taken with us as last resources against starvation. They
were, as M&rsquo;Gary worded it, &ldquo;meat on the hoof,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;able to carry their own fat over the floes.&rdquo; Once, near
Weary Man&rsquo;s Rest, I had been on the point of killing
them; but they had been the leaders of our winter&rsquo;s team,
and we could not bear the sacrifice.</p>

<p>I need not detail our journey any further. Within a
day or two we shot another seal, and from that time forward
had a full supply of food.</p>

<p>And now, with the apparent certainty of reaching our
homes, came that nervous apprehension which follows upon
hope long deferred. I could not trust myself to take the
outside passage, but timidly sought the quiet-water channels
running deep into the archipelago which forms a sort of
labyrinth along the coast.</p>

<p>Thus it was that at one of our sleeping-halts upon the
rocks&mdash;for we still adhered to the old routine&mdash;Petersen
awoke me with a story. He had just seen and recognised
a native, who, in his frail kayack, was evidently
seeking eider-down among the islands. The man had once
been an inmate of his family. &ldquo;Paul Zacharias, don&rsquo;t you
know me? I&rsquo;m Carl Petersen!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;his wife says he&rsquo;s dead;&rdquo; and, with a stolid expression
of wonder, he stared for a moment at the long beard that
loomed at him through the fog, and paddled away with all
the energy of fright.</p>

<p>Two days after this, a mist had settled down upon the
islands which embayed us, and when it lifted we found
ourselves rowing, in lazy time, under the shadow of Karkamoot.
Just then a familiar sound came to us over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">« 225 »</a></span>
water. We had often listened to the screeching of the
gulls or the bark of the fox, and mistaken it for the
&ldquo;Huk&rdquo; of the Esquimaux; but this had about it an inflection
not to be mistaken, for it died away in the familiar
cadence of a &ldquo;halloo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Petersen! oars, men!&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&mdash;and
he listened quietly at first, and then, trembling, said, in a
half whisper, &ldquo;Dannemarkers!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carlie Mossyn</div>

<p>By-and-by&mdash;for we must have been pulling a good half-hour&mdash;the
single mast of a small shallop showed itself;
and Petersen, who had been very quiet and grave, burst
out into an incoherent fit of crying, only relieved by
broken exclamations of mingled Danish and English. &ldquo;Tis
the Upernavik oil-boat! The Fraulein Flaischer! Carlie
Mossyn, the cooper, must be on his road to Kingatok for
blubber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Carlie Mossyn, sure enough. The quiet routine
of a Danish settlement is the same, year after year, and
Petersen had hit upon the exact state of things. The
<i>Mariane</i> was at Proven, and Carlie Mossyn had come up
in the Fraulein Flaischer to get the year&rsquo;s supply of blubber
from Kingatok.</p>

<p>Here we first got our cloudy, vague idea of what had
passed in the big world during our absence. The friction
of its fierce rotation had not much disturbed this little
outpost of civilisation, and we thought it a sort of blunder
as he told us that France and England were leagued with
the Mussulman against the Greek Church. He was a good
Lutheran, this assistant cooper, and all news with him had
a theological complexion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of America, eh, Petersen?&rdquo;&mdash;and we all looked,
waiting for him to interpret the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;America?&rdquo; said Carlie; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know much of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">« 226 »</a></span>
country here, for they have no whalers on the coast; but
a steamer and a barque passed up a fortnight ago, and
have gone out into the ice to seek your party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How gently all the lore of this man oozed out of him!
he seemed an oracle, as, with hot-tingling fingers pressed
against the gunwale of the boat, we listened to his words.
&ldquo;Sebastopol is not taken.&rdquo; Where and what was Sebastopol?</p>

<p>But &ldquo;Sir John Franklin?&rdquo; There we were at home
again,&mdash;our own delusive little speciality rose uppermost.
Franklin&rsquo;s party, or traces of the dead which represented
it, had been found nearly a thousand miles to the south of
where we had been searching for them. He knew it; for
the priest had a German newspaper which told all about
it. And so we &ldquo;out oars&rdquo; again, and rowed into the fogs.</p>

<p>Another sleeping-halt has passed, and we have all washed
clean at the fresh-water basins, and furbished up our ragged
furs and woollens. Kasarsoak, the snow top of Sanderson&rsquo;s
Hope, shows itself above the mists, and we hear the yelling
of the dogs. Petersen had been foreman of the settlement,
and he calls my attention, with a sort of pride, to
the tolling of the workmen&rsquo;s bell. It is six o&rsquo;clock. We
are nearing the end of our trials. Can it be a dream?</p>

<p>We hugged the land by the big harbour, turned the
corner by the old brew-house, and, in the midst of a crowd of
children, hauled our boats for the last time upon the rocks.</p>

<p>For eighty-four days we had lived in the open air. Our
habits were hard and weather-worn. We could not remain
within the four walls of a house without a distressing sense
of suffocation. But we drank coffee that night before
many a hospitable threshold, and listened again and again
to the hymn of welcome, which, sung by many voices,
greeted our deliverance.</p>

<p class="caption3">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p class="p0">We received all manner of kindness from the Danes of Upernavik.
They gave us many details of the expeditions in
search of Sir John Franklin, and added the painful news that
my gallant friend and comrade, Bellot, had perished in a
second crusade to save him. We knew each other by many
common sympathies: I had divided with him the hazards
of mutual rescue among the ice-fields; and his last letter to
me, just before I left New York, promised me the hope
that we were to meet again in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, and that he
would unite himself with our party as a volunteer. The
French service never lost a more chivalrous spirit.</p>

<p>The Danish vessel was not ready for her homeward
journey till the 4th of September; but the interval was
well spent in regaining health and gradually accustoming
ourselves to in-door life and habits. It is a fact, which
the physiologist will not find it difficult to reconcile with
established theories, that we were all more prostrated by
the repose and comfort of our new condition than we had
been by nearly three months of constant exposure and
effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Home, Sweet Home!</div>

<p>On the 6th I left Upernavik, with all our party, in the
<i>Mariane</i>, a staunch but antiquated little barque, under the
command of Captain Ammondson, who promised to drop
us at the Shetland Islands. Our little boat, the <i>Faith</i>,
which was regarded by all of us as a precious relic, took
passage along with us. Except the furs on our backs,
and the documents that recorded our labours and our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">« 228 »</a></span>
trials, it was all we brought back of the <i>Advance</i> and her
fortunes.</p>

<p>On the 11th we arrived at Godhavn, and had a characteristic
welcome from my excellent friend, Mr Olrik. The
<i>Mariane</i> had stopped only to discharge a few stores and
receive her papers of clearance; but her departure was held
back to the latest moment, in hopes of receiving news of
Captain Hartstene&rsquo;s squadron, which had not been heard
of since the 21st of July.</p>

<p>We were upon the eve of setting out, however, when the
look-out man at the hill-top announced a steamer in the
distance. It drew near, with a barque in tow, and we
soon recognised the stars and stripes of our own country.
The <i>Faith</i> was lowered for the last time into the water,
and the little flag which had floated so near the poles of
both hemispheres, opened once more to the breeze. With
Brooks at the tiller, and Mr Olrik at my side, followed by
all the boats of the settlement, we went out to meet them.</p>

<p>Never did the men lay to their oars more heartily. We
neared the squadron and the gallant men that had come
out to seek us; we could see the scars which their own
ice-battles had impressed on the vessels; we knew the gold
lace of the officers&rsquo; cap-bands, and discerned the groups
who, glass in hand, were evidently regarding us.</p>

<p>Presently we were alongside. An officer, whom I shall
ever remember as a cherished friend, Captain Hartstene,
hailed a little man in a ragged flannel shirt, &ldquo;Is that Dr
Kane?&rdquo; and with the &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; that followed, the rigging
was manned by our countrymen, and cheers welcomed us
back to the social world of love which they represented.</p>

Produced by Tom Cosmas from materials made available on
The Internet Archive

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
